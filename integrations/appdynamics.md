## AppDynamics Integration

The AppDynamics integration is a native integration that offers agentless ingestion of metrics from a AppDynamics SaaS service.

### Metrics Configuration
This integration can be configured to pull all application metrics from AppDynamics. If you want to pull only certain application metrics, configure filters while setting up the integration.

Metrics that originate from AppDynamics are prefixed with `appdynamics.apps.` in Wavefront. After you set up the integration, you can browse the available metrics in the metrics browser.
