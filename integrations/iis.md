## IIS Integration

Internet Information Services (IIS) for WindowsÂ® Server is a flexible, secure and manageable Web server for internet hosting.
This integration installs and configures Telegraf to send IIS metrics into Wavefront. Telegraf is a light-weight server process capable of collecting, processing, aggregating, and sending metrics to a [Wavefront proxy](https://docs.wavefront.com/proxies.html).

In addition to setting up the metrics flow, this integration also installs a dashboard. Here's the WWW(Web) Services section of a dashboard displaying IIS metrics:

## IIS Setup

This integration uses Windows performance counters specific to the IIS Telegraf input plugin.



Supported IIS Version(s): IIS 6.0 & later{% raw %}
```
This integration is supported only on Windows.
```
{% endraw %}

### Step 1: Set up a Wavefront Proxy

If you do not have a [Wavefront proxy](https://docs.wavefront.com/proxies.html) installed on your network, install a proxy.

### Step 2: Install the Telegraf Agent

{% include windows_telegraf.md %}

### Step 3: Configure the IIS Input Plugin

Edit the `telegraf.conf` file located in `Program Files\Telegraf\` and enter the following snippet:
{% raw %}
   ```
   [[inputs.win_perf_counters]]
     [[inputs.win_perf_counters.object]]
       # IIS, Web Service
       ObjectName = "Web Service"
       Counters = [
                    "Service Uptime", "Current Connections", "Bytes Sent/sec", "Total Bytes Sent",

       Instances = ["*"]
       Measurement = "iis.websvc.cache"
       IncludeTotal=true #Set to false to not include _Total instance.

     [[inputs.win_perf_counters.object]]
       # IIS, ASP.NET
       ObjectName = "ASP.NET"
       Counters = [
                    "Application Restarts", "Requests Queued",

       ObjectName = "HTTP Service Request Queues"
       Instances = ["*"]
       Counters = ["CurrentQueueSize","RejectedRequests"]
       Measurement = "iis.http.queues"
       #IncludeTotal=false #Set to true to include _Total instance when querying for all (*).
   ```
{% endraw %}
   
**Note:** On `IIS` dashboard, the **System Performance** section uses Windows system metrics configured by default in Telegraf. 

To see data in the **Avg Disk Latency** chart, make sure the following properties for `LogicalDisk` object are set in the Telegraf config file:
* `Avg. Disk sec/Read` and `Avg. Disk sec/Write` in `Counters` section.
* `IncludeTotal = true`.

Example:
{% raw %}
```
[[inputs.win_perf_counters.object]]
ObjectName = "LogicalDisk"
Instances = ["*"]
Counters = ["% Disk Read Time", "% Disk Write Time", "% Free Space", "% Idle Time", "Avg. Disk Bytes/Read", "Avg. Disk Bytes/Write", "Avg. Disk Queue Length", "Avg. Disk sec/Read", "Avg. Disk sec/Write", "Avg. Disk Write Queue Length", "Free Megabytes", "Split IO/Sec"]
Measurement = "win.disk"
IncludeTotal = true
```
{% endraw %}

### Step 4: Restart the Telegraf service

Use the `Windows Services Management Console` or execute the following from the command prompt:
{% raw %}
   ```
   net stop telegraf
   net start telegraf
   ```
{% endraw %}
