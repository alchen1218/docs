## VMware PKS Integration

VMware PKS enables operators to provision, operate, and manage enterprise-grade Kubernetes clusters. This integration uses [wavefront-kubernetes-collector](https://github.com/wavefrontHQ/wavefront-kubernetes-collector), a collector agent that runs natively in Kubernetes and [kube-state-metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics), a simple service that listens to the Kubernetes API server and generates metrics. The integration collects detailed metrics about the containers, namespaces, nodes, pods, deployments, services and the cluster itself. See [VMware PKS Integration Details](https://docs.wavefront.com/integrations_pks.html) for a list of predefined alerts, an architecture overview, and troubleshooting info.

This integration explains how to configure VMware PKS monitoring with Wavefront from the PKS tile present in PCF Ops Manager. After you've completed the integration setup, you can use Wavefront to monitor the VMware PKS cluster.

In addition to setting up the metrics flow, this integration also installs a dashboard. Here's a preview of **Overview** and **Nodes** section of the dashboard.

## VMware PKS Setup

  **Note:** For VMware PKS 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 versions, see the [VMware PKS (Archived)](../pks-archived/overview) integration in the **Archived** section.

### Configuring the Wavefront Account

1. Log in to PCF Ops Manager and click the **Pivotal Container Service** tile in Installation Dashboard.
2. Under the **Settings** tab, click **Monitoring**.
3. In the right pane, check **Yes** to enable **Wavefront Integration** and enter the account information:
   * **Wavefront URL**: `https://YOUR_CLUSTER.wavefront.com/api`
   * **API Token**: `YOUR_API_TOKEN`
   * **Wavefront Alert Recipient**: `A list of Email addresses &/or Wavefront Target IDs`

Wavefront monitoring will be active for any cluster that is created after you have saved the configuration settings and applied the changes.
