## Telegraf Integration

Telegraf is a light-weight server process capable of collecting, processing, and aggregating metrics. This integration describes how to install and configure Telegraf to send metrics to a [Wavefront proxy](https://docs.wavefront.com/proxies.html).

In addition to setting up the metrics flow of the system and the applications, this integration also allows you to monitor the performance of Telegraf and installs a dashboard. Here's a preview of Telegraf dashboard:

**Note:** Telegraf dashboard shows `NO DATA` if the `internal` plugin is not enabled.

## Telegraf Setup



You can choose automatic installation or manual installation and configuration.

### Install Wavefront Proxy and Telegraf Agent Automatically

Log in to your Wavefront instance and follow the instructions in the **Setup** tab to install Telegraf and a Wavefront proxy in your environment. If a proxy is already running in your environment, you can select that proxy and the Telegraf install command connects with that proxy. Sign up for a [free trial](http://wavefront.com/sign-up/?utm_source=docs.vmware.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=docs-front-page){:target="_blank" rel="noopenner noreferrer"} to check it out!

### Install and Configure Wavefront Proxy and Telegraf Agent Manually

*Linux*: Follow the steps under [linux/setup]({% link integrations/linux.md %}).

*Mac*: Follow the steps under [mac/setup]({% link integrations/mac.md %}).

*Windows*: Follow the steps under [windows/setup]({% link integrations/windows.md %}).

### Insights into Telegraf Performance (Optional)

If you want to monitor the performance of the Telegraf agent, follow these steps:

Create a `telegraf.conf` file in `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.d` and add the following snippet:
{% raw %}
```
    # Collect internal Telegraf statistics
    [[inputs.internal]]
      ## If true, collect Telegraf memory stats.
        collect_memstats = true

        name_prefix = "telegraf."
```
{% endraw %}
**Note:** The Telegraf dashboard shows `NO DATA` if this plugin is not enabled.

### Restart Telegraf
