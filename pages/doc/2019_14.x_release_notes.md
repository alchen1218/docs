## Azure Integration 
* Improved Azure integration to account for lag in metrics availability in Azure.

## Distributed Tracing (Beta) Enhancements

### Traces Browser and Service Map
* The [Traces browser](tracing_ui_overview.html#explore-traces) supports a streamlined task flow for examining traces. You can perform trace queries, view query results, expand traces to see their member spans, and expand individual spans to see their details, without having to navigate between pages and pop-ups.

* The [service map](tracing_ui_overview.html#investigate-the-service-flow-for-a-trace) in the Traces browser shows the services involved in a trace. The service map lets you examine: 
  - Service dependencies 
  - Flow of request calls between the services 
  - Health of the service (RED metrics) without navigating to another page

### Trace Queries

* [Query Builder](trace_data_query.html#trace-query-menus-and-fields) now lets you to filter on the minimum or maximum duration of entire traces. You no longer specify span-level durations.

* The new [`traces()`](traces_function.html) function replaces the `spans()` function for performing trace queries. 
  - `traces()` accepts the same parameters as `spans()`, but returns a list of whole traces instead of a list of spans that are mapped to traces. 
  - You can use `traces()` with the [filtering functions](traces_function.html#filtering-functions) `limit()`, `highpass()`, and `lowpass()`. 
  - You can no longer use [`spans()`](spans_function.html) from the UI. However, you can use `spans()` with the REST API to obtain a JSON list of matching spans. 

### OpenCensus Support


### Trace-Level RED Metrics

* You can now query for [trace-level RED metrics](trace_data_details.html#operation-level-and-trace-level-red-metrics), which are derived from each traceâ€™s root span and end span. Trace-level metrics are primarily useful for measuring the durations of traces that have asynchronous spans, especially when a child span extends beyond the root span.
