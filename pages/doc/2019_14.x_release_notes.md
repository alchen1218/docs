## Distributed Tracing (Beta) Enhancements

This release continues to enhance our Distributed Tracing offering:

* The UI now supports a more streamlined task flow for examining traces. The new Traces browser lets you perform a trace query, view the results, expand a trace to see its member spans, and expand an individual span to see its details, without having to navigate between pages and pop-ups.

* The new Traces browser includes a service map which lets you view the services that contribute spans to a selected trace. In the service map, you can view the service dependencies, and follow the flow of request calls between the services that are involved in a trace. You can check the health of the service by inspecting the RED metrics on the same page.

* In the new Traces browser, Query Builder lets you to filter query results based on the duration of the returned traces. You can no longer filter based on the duration of individual spans.

* The new `traces()` function replaces the `spans()` function for performing trace queries. `traces()` accepts the same parameters as `spans()`, but returns a list of whole traces instead of a list of spans that are mapped to traces. The filtering functions `limit()`, `highpass()`, and `lowpass()` now return filtered lists of traces instead of filtered lists of spans that are mapped to traces. 

* The `spans()` function is no longer used by Query Builder for browsing traces. Furthermore, if you use QueryEditor to enter a `spans()` query, the Traces browser will display No Data. You can still use `spans()` with the REST API if you want to obtain a JSON list of matching spans. 


* Wavefront now derives trace-level RED metrics in addition to operation-level RED metrics. Trace-level RED metrics measure the traces that start with a given root operation, and are derived from each traceâ€™s root span and end span. (If a trace has multiple root spans, the earliest is used.) For example, a trace-level metric might measure the number of traces that each start with a call to the `orderShirts` operation in the `shopping` service. 

  **Note:** For traces that consist entirely of synchronous member spans, trace-level RED metrics are equivalent to the corresponding operation-level RED metrics. For traces that have asynchronous member spans, trace-level RED metrics provide more accurate measures of trace duration, especially when a trace's root span ends before a child span.
