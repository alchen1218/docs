## New Histogram Manipulation Functions

This release includes two functions for making [histogram visualization](proxies_histograms.html#using-summary-and-alignedsummary-for-histogram-visualization) easier:
* The `summary()` function returns a summary of a histogram.
* The `alignedSummary()` function returns an aligned summary of a histogram.

For both functions, we return the the following information by default:
```
max, P999, P99, P90, P75, avg, median (P50), P25, and min
```
You can specify a list of percentiles instead.

## New and Changed Functions

* New forecasting function, [`nnforecast`](ts_nnforecast.html), which uses uses hypothesis testing and neural networks for prediction. This function is used by the AI Genie forecasting UI.
* New [string functions](query_language_reference.html#string-functions).
* For the `at()` function, new parameter `lookbackDistance`. When you call `at(end)` or `at(now)`, we look back by 1 hour by default. You can now specify a time span instead.

## Updates to Spy API

In earlier releases, you could use the `spy` API to examine metric points and IDs. With this release, you can also examine spans.
