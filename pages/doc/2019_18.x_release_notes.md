## New Histogram Manipulation Functions

This release includes two functions for making histogram visualization easier:
* The `summary()` function returns a summary of a histogram.
* The `alignedSummary` function returns an aligned summary of a histogram.
For both functions, we return the max, P999, P99, P90, P75, avg, median (P50), P25, and min values by default. You can specify an arbitrary percentile list instead.  

## New and Changed Functions

* New forecasting function, [`nnforecast`](ts_nnforecast.html), which uses uses hypothesis testing and neural networks for prediction. This function is used by the AI Genie forecasting UI.
* New string functions.
* New parameter `lookbackDistance` for the `at()` function. When you call `at(end)` or `at(now)`, we look back by 1 hour by default. You can specify a time span instead.
