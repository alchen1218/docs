## Distributed Tracing Enhancement

This release includes several enhancements to the tracing service and UI. We also continue to improve and add to our SDKs, available on Github.

Here's what's new:
* **Sample application**. If you select **Applications > Traces**, and if we can't find trace data in your environment, then we show you the Beach Shirts sample app so you can explore tracing on sample data. If you set up your environment to send trace data to Wavefront, we display your information instead of the sample app.
* **System metrics collected by default**. If your environment includes Telegraf agents that support system metrics to Wavefront, we display those metrics in the System tab.

* **Percentile indicator** A new percentile indicator lets you spot potential outliers. It shows for each trace where it falls in comparison to other traces:

## Wavefront v2 UI for Dashboards and Charts (Beta)

This release rolls out a Beta of the v2 dashboard and charts. Some customers will offer users an option to try the new UI, while others will have access in a later release. Here's a list of feature highlights:

* **Create Dashboard** workflow allows all users to quickly create a dashboard and add charts. You specify the metrics to monitor, optional filters and functions. You can rearrange charts to snap to a grid, with a maximum of 12 charts per row.
* **Chart Builder** is available in all charts and supports easy setup of your charts from the UI. Advanced users can select Query Editor in the Data tab of Chart Builder, and can make Query Editor the default.
* **Dashboard Variables** support a more intuitive workflow, both for users who create or edit variables and for users who select variable values.
