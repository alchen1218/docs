## Span Logs for Distributed Tracing

Span logs capture span-specific logging information and are supported by the OpenTracing standard. This release supports span logs.

* Instrument one or more logs with a span.
* View span logs in the Traces browser.

You can instrument your application or customize a Wavefront SDK to include span log information. Some Wavefront SDKs include span logs for errors by default.

## Alert Routes for Fine-Tuning Alert Notifications

Use alert routes if you want to fine-tune which recipient receives which alert notification. You can specify a source name, metric name, or point tag name and value, and filter who gets notified based on that.

You [specify alert routes](webhooks_alert_notification.html#add-custom-alert-routes). 

## Documentation & Videos

* Reorganized some information for easier access to data ingestion and proxy information. Filenames did not change so bookmarks still work.
* Updated information about [Proxy Preprocessor Rules](proxies_preprocessor_rules.html) to include info on rules for spans and histograms.
* Two new lightboard videos from Clement [Introduction to Wavefront](https://youtu.be/90mw6Vcmlt4) and [Wavefront Proxy](https://youtu.be/Lrm8UuxrsqA).
