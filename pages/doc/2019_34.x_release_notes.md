## Tracing Improvements

<!--- clone page --->

Selecting **Application > Inventory** takes you to a searchable page that provides a status summary for each of your instrumented applications. The status summary for an application includes RED metrics that show:
- The total number of requests that are represented by the application's spans. 
- The percentage of the application's spans that contain errors.
- The span duration (in seconds) at the 95th percentile across the application.

Click the name of an application to display a searchable page with the status summary for each of the application's services. The status summary for a service includes RED metrics that show:

  - The span duration (in seconds) at the 95th percentile across the service.

## Other

* New function [globalFilter()](ts_globalFilter.html). This function is similar to [retainSeries()](ts_retainSeries.html), but filters are pushed all the way into the inner ts()/hs() expressions. That means you can use `globalFilter()` to filter data pre-aggregation.

## Documentation & Videos

* Video on our open-source Wavefront Top tool.
