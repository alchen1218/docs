## Improvements to v2 Dashboards and Charts

* Miscellaneous usability improvements based on customer feedback


## Tracing Improvements

### Overview Pages for Application and Service Status

Selecting **Applications > Application Status** now takes you to a searchable page that provides RED metrics for each of your instrumented applications:

Clicking the name of an application now takes you to a searchable page with RED metrics for each of the applicationâ€™s services:

![app services](images/tracing_app_services.png)


### Cloning a Service Metrics Dashboard

You can now clone a service metrics dashboard to:
* Add your own charts.
* Remove, rearrange, or customize the RED metrics charts. (Use the [ts_countersum](ts_countersum.html) function to display RED metrics.)

**Note:** For best results, [use the V2 UI version for your dashboard display](users_account_managing.html#switch-between-ui-versions).

## Other

* New function [globalFilter()](ts_globalFilter.html). This function is similar to [retainSeries()](ts_retainSeries.html), but filters are pushed all the way into the inner ts()/hs() expressions. That means you can use `globalFilter()` to filter data pre-aggregation.

## Documentation & Videos

* Video on our open-source Wavefront Top tool.
