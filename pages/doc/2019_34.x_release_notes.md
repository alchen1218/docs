## Improvements to v2 Dashboards and Charts

* Click on a single-stat chart to edit the chart.

## Tracing Improvements

### Overview Pages for Application and Service Status

Selecting **Application > Inventory** now takes you to a searchable page that provides RED metrics for each of your instrumented applications:

Clicking the name of an application now takes you to a searchable page with RED metrics for each of the applicationâ€™s services:

### Cloning a Service Metrics Page

You can now clone the service metrics page to add or customize charts.

## Other

* New function [globalFilter()](ts_globalFilter.html). This function is similar to [retainSeries()](ts_retainSeries.html), but filters are pushed all the way into the inner ts()/hs() expressions. That means you can use `globalFilter()` to filter data pre-aggregation.

## Documentation & Videos

* Video on our open-source Wavefront Top tool.
