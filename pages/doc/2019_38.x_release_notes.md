## Ingestion Policies and Per-Policy Usage Monitoring

This release supports [ingestion policies](ingestion_policies.html) lets you find out which accounts (user or service accounts) are responsible for which part of total ingestion.
* Admins with Account Management permissions can create one or more ingestion policies and add accounts to each policies. To avoid duplication, each account can belong to only one policy.
* All users can view the ingestion breakdown dashboard, that we added to the Wavefront Usage integration. This preconfigured dashboard:
  - Includes Usage by Ingestion Policy and Usage by Account and helps you explore usage patterns.
  - Allows you to track usage history.
  - Supports export to CSV.

## Auto-Generated Alerts for RED Metrics

By default, Wavefront [alerts on RED metrics](tracing_basics.html#trace-data-alerts) when they exceed performance thresholds or behave anomalously. You can configure these auto-generated alerts from the Alert Integration. For any alert, you can specify alert thresholds and the alert target. You can also clone and further customize the alert.

## Chart Improvements (v2)

Our v2 UI has several dashboard improvements in this release.

### Faster Chart Loading with Sampling

To support faster loading of charts, this release supports a **Sampling** preference for each user that you can override for each chart.
* When **Sampling** is on for a chart, we display a maximum of 100 time series.
* You can toggle **Sampling** with a global preference or from the **Sampling** pulldown menu on charts in edit mode.

### Drilldown for Single Stat Charts

Single stat charts now include a Drilldown Link tab that allows you to specify a target dashboard. You can optionally specify the target dashboard, for example, specify a point tag to passed in as a variable.

## Histogram Management Functions

This release makes several histogram distribution functions publicly available.
* The [cdf() function](ts_cdf.html) is a cumulative distribution funtion for histograms. You can use it to find out how likely it is that a histogram is less than or equal to a specified value.
* The [histo() function](ts_histo.html) returns a histogram distribution for a time series.
* The [cumulativeHisto() function](ts_cumulativeHisto.html) allows you to visualize cumulative histograms, such as those coming from Prometheus or Telegraf in Wavefront charts.
