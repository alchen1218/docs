## Ingestion Policies and Per-Policy Usage Monitoring

This release supports [ingestion policies](ingestion_policies.html) lets you find out which accounts (user or service accounts) are responsible for which part of total ingestion.
* Admins with Account Management permissions can create one or more ingestion policies and add accounts to each policies. To avoid duplication, each account can belong to only one policy.
* All users can view the ingestion breakdown dashboard, that we added to the Wavefront Usage integration. This preconfigured dashboard includes Usage by Ingestion Policy and Usage by Account and helps you explore usage patterns.

## Dashboard Enhancements

This release supports several enhancements to dashboards.

In addition, an improved drag-and-drop UI allows you to optimize dashboard layout, like this:

## Tracing Auto Alerts

By default, Wavefront alerts on RED metrics when they exceed performance thresholds or behave anomalously. You can configure these auto-generated alerts from the Alert Integration.

## Miscellaneous Improvements

To support faster loading of charts, this release supports a **Sampling** preference for each user that you can override for each chart.
* When **Sampling** is on for a chart, we display a maximum of 100 time series.
* You can toggle **Sampling** with a global preference or from the **Sampling** pulldown menu on charts in edit mode.
