## Ingestion Policies and Per-Policy Usage Monitoring

This release supports [ingestion policies](ingestion_policies.html) lets you find out which accounts (user or service accounts) are responsible for which part of total ingestion.
* Admins with Account Management permissions can create one or more ingestion policies and add accounts to each policies. To avoid duplication, each account can belong to only one policy.
* All users can view the ingestion breakdown dashboard, that we added to the Wavefront Usage integration. This preconfigured dashboard includes Usage by Ingestion Policy and Usage by Account and helps you explore usage patterns.

## Tracing Auto Alerts

By default, Wavefront [alerts on RED metrics](tracing_basics.html#trace-data-alerts) when they exceed performance thresholds or behave anomalously.
