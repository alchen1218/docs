## Dashboard Improvements (v2)

Our v2 UI has several dashboard improvements in this release. If your cluster has v2 enabled, you can switch UI versions [from the gear icon](users_account_managing.html#switch-between-ui-versions).

### Undo in Dashboard Edit Mode

## Topk and Node Map Charts (v2)

This release supports full edit functionality for topk and node map charts. These chart types were available only as read-only charts. In this release both chart types are available. They support color mapping and drilldown.

## Intelligent Trace Sampling

We now support intelligent trace sampling. 

## Query Language Changes

* We now allow lower case or all caps for the strings `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` for better legibility of long combinations of metrics.
* The [`timespan() event management function`](event_timespan.html) now supports adding tags with a time expression. Before, only Epoch time was supported.
* The terms `high` and `low` are now reserved keywords. If you want to query for the string "high" or "low" you have to use double quotes. For example, `ts(my.metric AND current_value="high")` queries for `my.metric` but returns only instances where the point tag `current_value` is set to "high".
