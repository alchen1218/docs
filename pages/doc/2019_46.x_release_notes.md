## Dashboard Improvements (v2)

Our v2 UI has several dashboard improvements in this release. If your cluster has v2 enabled, you can switch UI versions [from the gear icon](users_account_managing.html#switch-between-ui-versions).

### Undo in Dashboard Edit Mode

<ul>
<li>Specify a key-value pair as a filter for the dashboard. <br><br>All filters show up to the right of any dashboard variables</li> <li>Remove the filter by clicking the <strong>X</strong>. </li></ul></td>
<td width="60%"><img src="/images/global_filters.png" alt="Global filter set and see"/></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Drilldown Link Option for All Chart Types

The [drilldown link option](ui_charts_faq.html#how-do-drilldown-links-work), available for single stat charts in the last release, is now available for all chart types.

If you've specified a drilldown link for a chart, users who click on a chart are redirected to a a specified target dashboard. During drilldown link creation, you can optionally pass in a value from the origin chart.

* Topk, node map, and single stat charts allow you to pass a variety of values, including source etc.
* For all other charts you can pass in a dashboard variables from the current chart or a constant.

## Topk and Node Map Charts (v2)

This release supports full edit functionality for [**topk charts**](ui_chart_reference.html#topk-chart) and [**node map charts**](ui_chart_reference.html#node-map-chart). These chart types were available only as read-only charts. They now support color mapping and drilldown links.

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
A <strong>topk chart</strong> shows the most critical time series (8 by default) as horizontal bars.
<ul>
<li>Add a color mapping to highlight values</li>
<li>Specify the number of bars and other details such as the bar label, bar header, etc.</li>
<li>Specify a drilldown link that directs users to a different dashboard when they click on a bar.</li></ul></td>
<td width="60%"><img src="images/topk.png" alt="topk chart"/></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
A <strong>node map</strong> shows colored 3-D cubes ordered from highest to lowest based on source values.
<ul>
<li>When a user clicks a node, a small popup of the corresponding metric for that source results.</li>
<li>If a drilldown link is specified, users are directedto a different dashboard if they click a node.</li>
<li>An animation unfurls the node map when the page refreshes. </li></ul></td>
<td width="60%"><img src="images/node_map.png" alt="node map chart"/></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<!--- Moved to 38.x. Can likely cut this.
## Intelligent Trace Sampling

Starting with this release, Wavefront automatically performs [intelligent sampling](trace_data_sampling.html#wavefront-intelligent-sampling) to reduce the volume of ingested traces. Using proprietary algorithms, we retain traces that are likely to be informative, and discard traces that are redundant or otherwise not worth inspecting.

You can use Wavefront intelligent sampling in conjunction with explicit sampling strategies.--->

## Query Language Changes

* We now allow lower case or all caps for the strings `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` for better legibility of long combinations of metrics.
* The [`timespan() event management function`](event_timespan.html) now supports adding tags with a time expression. Before, only Epoch time was supported.
* The terms `high` and `low` are now reserved keywords. If you want to query for the string "high" or "low" you have to use double quotes. For example, `ts(my.metric AND current_value="high")` queries for `my.metric` but returns only instances where the point tag `current_value` is set to "high".
