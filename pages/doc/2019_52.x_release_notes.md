## Dashboards for Large Demo Screens
Wavefront customers have asked for a version of dashboards that is suitable for large demo screens, for example, a large TV screen inside your enterprise:
* Auth-less (No need to log in again)
* No timeout
* Read only
We've solved this problem by offering configuration of an Ubuntu Linux VM that runs inside the customer network.
