## Authorization Model Changes

In earlier releases, Wavefront supported users, groups, and permissions. We've expanded this model to a full implementation of Role-based Access Control (RBAC).
* As before, you can assign permissions to users.
* You can create roles, assign permissions to those roles, and assign roles to users and groups.

### Upgrade Considerations

You can no longer assign permissions to groups. If your environment included groups with permissions, we will create a role with the same name as the group and assign that role to the group.

## Dashboard Page Version for Large Demo Screens

Wavefront customers have asked for a version of dashboards that is suitable for large demo screens:
* Auth-less (No need to log in again)
* No timeout
* Read only

We've solved this problem by offering configuration of an Ubuntu Linux VM that runs inside the customer network.
