## Authorization Model Enhancements

In earlier releases, Wavefront supported users, groups, and permissions. We've expanded this model to a full implementation of Role-based Access Control (RBAC), resulting in this workflow:
1. Create one or more roles, which are sets of permissions.
2. Create groups of users.
3. Assign one or more roles to each group.

Assigning roles to users is also supported, but assinging roles to groups is preferred.

### Upgrade Considerations

You can no longer assign permissions to groups. If your environment included groups with permissions, we will create a role with the same name as the group and assign that role to the group.

## Dashboards for Large Demo Screens

Wavefront customers have asked for a version of dashboards that is suitable for large demo screens, for example, a large TV screen inside your enterprise:
* Auth-less (No need to log in again)
* No timeout
* Read only

We've solved this problem by offering configuration of an Ubuntu Linux VM that runs inside the customer network.

## Retrieve Ingested Span Logs with Spy

You can now [retrieve ingested span logs with Spy](wavefront_monitoring_spy.html#get-ingested-span-logs-with-spy) with the existing trace ID, span ID, and the respective event that created the log.

## Create Service Dashboards from a Template

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<p>You can now create your own service dashboard from our template and customize it to monitor the trace data sent by each service in your application. All charts in the current service dashboard are included in the template. You can add, remove, and customize charts, then save your service dashboard. See <a href="ui_dashboards.html#create-a-dashboard-from-a-tracing-template">Create a Dashboard from a Tracing Template</a> for details.<br>
{% include note.html content="To view data in these charts, your applications need to send trace data to Wavefront. See [Instrument Your Applications for details](tracing_instrumenting_frameworks.html)." %}
</p></td>
<td width="60%"><img src="/images/create_tracing_template.png" alt="Create a dashboard from a tracing template"/></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Tracing UI Improvements

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<p>You can <a href="ui_examine_data.html#fine-tune-the-time-window">fine-tune the time window</a> of your RED metrics charts on the tracing UI.
</p></td>
<td width="60%"><img src="/images/tracing_fine_tune_RED_metrics_charts.png" alt="Fine tune RED metrics charts"/></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Display Dashboards on Large Demo Screens

Wavefront customers have asked for a version of dashboards that is suitable for large demo screens, for example, a large TV screen inside your enterprise. This type of setup has no time-out, doesn't require authorization, and is read only.

Starting with this release, simple [configuration of NGINX on an Ubuntu Linux VM](large_screen_display.html) that runs inside the network gets you the desired result.

## New Video: About Cardinality

Watch Wavefront co-founder Clement Pang explain what cardinality means and why Wavefront performs so well with high-cardinality data.
