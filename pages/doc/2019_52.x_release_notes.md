## Authorization Model Enhancements

In earlier releases, Wavefront supported users, groups, and permissions. We've expanded this model to a full implementation of Role-based Access Control (RBAC), resulting in this workflow:
1. Create one or more roles, which are sets of permissions.
2. Create groups of users.
3. Assign one or more roles to each group.

Assigning roles to users is also supported, but assinging roles to groups is preferred.

### Upgrade Considerations

You can no longer assign permissions to groups. If your environment included groups with permissions, we will create a role with the same name as the group and assign that role to the group.

## Dashboards for Large Demo Screens

Wavefront customers have asked for a version of dashboards that is suitable for large demo screens, for example, a large TV screen inside your enterprise:
* Auth-less (No need to log in again)
* No timeout
* Read only

We've solved this problem by offering configuration of an Ubuntu Linux VM that runs inside the customer network.

This release includes a read-only histogram chart that is included in the tracing dashboard by default.
