## Role-Based Access Control

Starting with this release, Wavefront has full support for global [role-based access control (RBAC)](users_roles.html).

* Assign **users**  to **groups**.
* Assign **permissions** to **roles**.
* Assign **roles** to **groups** (preferred) or toindividual users.

If your environment includes groups that have been assigned permissions, the permissions will be migrated to a role with the same name and that role will be assigned to the group. The Wavefront customers success team will contact all customers that are undergoing that transition.

There are no changes to the access control for individual objects (dashboards and alerts). You can continue to grant access only to individual accounts and to groups.

## Obsolete and Deprecated APIs

The following APIs are now obsolete because permissions are no longer a part of user groups:
```
/api/v2/usergroup/grant/{permission}
/api/v2/usergroup/revoke/{permission}
```

When you search group APIs, you will no longer get a permission as a parameter because permissions are now associated with roles.
```
/api/v2/search/usergroup
/api/v2/search/usergroup/{facet}
/api/v2/search/usergroup/facets
```

The `Users` API is deprecated and will become obsolete in 1 year. Use the `Accounts` API instead.


## Tracing Changes

### Tracing Documentation and README Updates

To make our tracing SDKs more accessible to users, we've revised:
* Updated information about [Wavefront Observability SDKs](wavefront.sdks.html) so it's easier to find the SDK you need.
* Updated several README files in the [Wavefront Github Repository](https://github.com/wavefrontHQ) so it's easier to find and use our SDKs.
This work is ongoing -- Use PRs or email docs@wavefront.com with comments.

### Histogram to Tracing Drilldown

You can now drill down to a corresponding trace from a histogram chart.

### Search for Traces by ID

Search for traces by trace ID in the tracing UI.



## Other Changes

### Version Info Moves to Gear Icon (About)

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="60%">You can now access version information from the gear icon by selecting <strong>About</strong>. In earlier Wavefront releases, this information was at the bottom of each page.
</td>
<td width="40%"><img src="/images/about_menu.png" alt="Get version info from About menu item"/></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


### Operators gt, lt, ge, le, eq, ne

No operators allow you to easily [filter on the query line](query_language_recipes.html#compare-with-operators-lt-gt-le-ge-eq-ne). You can use multiple operators, for example, to find values that are between specified values, as in this example:

```
ts(~sample.mem.used.percentage).gt(70).lt(85)
```


### Alert Notification Iterators for Source Tags

Added the following iterators to the [alert notification template](alert_target_customizing.html):
- recoveredHostSourceTags
- newlyFailingHostSourceTags
- inMaintenanceHostSourceTags
- failingHostSourceTags

### New AWS Metrics

This release includes new metrics for AWS RDS:

* aws.rds.allocatedstorage
* aws.rds.capacity (Aurora only)
* aws.rds.backtrackconsumedchangerecords (Aurora only)

This change means that the [minimum list of permissions](integrations_aws_metrics.html#giving-wavefront-limited-access) new includes `rds:DescribeDBClusters`
