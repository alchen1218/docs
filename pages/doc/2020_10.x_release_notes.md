These release notes give an overview of the changes for Release 2020.10 of the Wavefront service. We also recently released a new version (6.1) of the Wavefront proxy. See the [Wavefront Proxy Release Notes](proxies_versions.html) for details.

## New Histogram Functions

This release includes the following new functions for managing histograms:

* [frequencyHisto()](ts_frequencyHisto.html) converts a histogram that comes from Google Cloud Platform, Telegraf, or any other source to Wavefront histogram format.
* [stddev()](hs_stddev.html) shows how the data in a histogram expression varies against the mean. Returns those values as a time series.

## AWS Integration Changes

* AWS Metrics+ Service Limit Metrics are now available in Wavefront.
  - Users must at least have a Business Level AWS Support plan.
  - Additional permissions are required. See [Giving Wavefront Global Read-Only Access](integrations_aws_overview.html#giving-wavefront-global-read-only-access) or [Giving Wavefront Limited Access](integrations_aws_overview.html#giving-wavefront-limited-access)
* We've revised the documentation for [Creating an IAM Policy to Specify Limited Access](integrations_aws_overview.html#create-iam-policy-to-specify-limited-access) to reflect some changes since we last published that document.
* For examples, see [AWS Metrics+ Trusted Advisor Service Limits](integrations_aws_metrics.html#aws-metrics-trusted-advisor-service-limits).
* For sample alerts, see [Alert Queries for AWS Trusted Advisor Service Limits](aws_trusted_advisor_alerts.html)

## Operators gt, lt, ge, le, eq, ne

The new operators allow you to easily [filter on the query line](query_language_recipes.html#compare-with-operators-lt-gt-le-ge-eq-ne). You can use multiple operators, for example, to find values that are between specified values, as in this example:

```
ts(~sample.mem.used.percentage).gt(70).lt(85)
```
