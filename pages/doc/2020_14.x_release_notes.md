These release notes give an overview of the changes for Release 2020.14 of the Wavefront service.

## Dashboard Wizard Supports Histogram Option

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="40%" markdown="span">The dashboard wizard allows you to [create a dashboard](ui_dashboards.html#create-a-dashboard) with one or more charts from data, charts, or integration templates. Going forward, if you select **Data** you're prompted to select metrics or histogram data.
</td>
<td width="60%"><img src="/images/create_dashboard_from_histogram.png" alt="Create dashboard from histogram"/>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Histogram Heat Map Chart

This release supports a [histogram heat map chart](visualize_histograms.html#visualize-histogram-distributions-in-a-heat-map).

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="40%" markdown="span">* Visualize histograms in three dimensions -- color saturation shows density, that is how many values are in this field.
* Select any field to show a hover legend that displays the full histogram and highlights the currently selected field.
</td>
<td width="60%"><img src="images/heat_map.png" alt="histogram heat map">
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


## Gauge Chart


<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="40%" markdown="span">This release supports gauge charts, which are similar to single stat charts but allow you to show the possible values in an outer ring and customize coloring for that outer ring.
</td>
<td width="60%"><img src="images/TBD.png" alt="gauge chart">
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Other Changes

We made several other improvements, some of them in response to customer requests:

### Dynamic Variables Support Wildcard Character for Point Tags

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="40%" markdown="span">The values of a [dynamic dashboard variable](dashboards_variables.html#dynamic-dashboard-variables) are determined by a query based on the state of the system at the time the query is executed. That makes it possible for users to select all point tag values or specific point tag values a dashboard that uses the variable.
</td>
<td width="60%"><img src="/images/select_point_tag_variable.png" alt="Select point tag variable"/>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Chart Builder Supports Selecting Histogram Data

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="40%" markdown="span">Chart builder allows you to select metrics or histogram distributions.
</td>
<td width="60%"><img src="images/chart_builder_histograms.png" alt="Histogram option in chart builder"/>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Change in AWS Integration

The AWS integration now uses the newer CloudWatch `GetMetricData` API to collect metrics.

{% include note.html content="If you've given Wavefront Read Only access, no action is required. If you've given Wavefront limited access, change the permissions [following this example](integrations_aws_overview.html#create-iam-policy-to-specify-limited-access)" %}

<!---
This change moved to the next release

### Additions to ~query.*.scanned Internal Metrics

New internal metrics allow you to monitor histograms and spans. The result is the following:

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="30%">~query.summaries_scanned</td>
<td width="70%">Per-second rate at which metrics are being queried from dashboards, alerts, charts or API calls.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="30%">~query.spans_scanned</td>
<td width="70%">Per-second rate at which spans are being queried from dashboards, alerts, charts or API calls.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="30%">~query.histograms_scanned</td>
<td width="70%">Per-second rate at which histograms are being queried from dashboards, alerts, charts or API calls.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
