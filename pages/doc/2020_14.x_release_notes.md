## Other Changes

We made several other improvements, some of them in response to customer requests:

### Dynamic Variables Support Wildcard Character for Point Tags

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="40%" markdown="span">The values of a [dynamic dashboard variable](dashboards_variables.html#dynamic-dashboard-variables) are determined by a query based on the state of the system at the time the query is executed. That makes it possible for users to select all point tag values or specific point tag values a dashboard that uses the variable.
</td>
<td width="60%"><img src="/images/select_point_tag_variable.png" alt="Select point tag variable"/>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

This change moved to the next release

### Additions to ~query.*.scanned Internal Metrics

New internal metrics allow you to monitor histograms and spans. The result is the following:

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="30%">~query.summaries_scanned</td>
<td width="70%">Per-second rate at which metrics are being queried from dashboards, alerts, charts or API calls.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="30%">~query.spans_scanned</td>
<td width="70%">Per-second rate at which spans are being queried from dashboards, alerts, charts or API calls.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="30%">~query.histograms_scanned</td>
<td width="70%">Per-second rate at which histograms are being queried from dashboards, alerts, charts or API calls.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
