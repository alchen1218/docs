These release notes give an overview of the changes for Release 2020.22 of the Wavefront service.

## Alert Viewer

Starting with this release, some alert notifications include a link to the new [Alert Viewer](alerts_manage.html#examine-an-alert-in-alert-viewer).

From there, you can view related alerts, drill down to responsible point tags, see past firings of the same alert, and more. Let us know what you think!


{% include note.html content="You can fine-tune what's included in the alert notification. See [How Alert Notifications Include Links](alerts_manage.html#how-alert-notifications-include-links)" %}

## Pie Chart

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="60%" markdown="span">The new [pie chart](ui_chart_reference.html#pie-and-donut-chart) lets you visualize data as pie slices or a donut. You can customize different aspects of this chart, for example, add a filter (Min, Max) or specify the maximum number of slices.

## New Functions and Enhanced Functions

This release includes the following new functions and enhancements to existing functions.



## Application Map (TBD)

<!---Update with changes or leave as is--->

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="40%" markdown="span">Get an overview of how the applications and services are linked, focus on a specific service, and view Request, Error, and Duration (RED) metrics for each service and the edges in the application using the new [application map](tracing_ui_overview.html#application-map-beta). That's not all, you can view traces for the services and edges and drill down from the application map.

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


## Other Changes

We made several other improvements, some of them in response to customer requests:

### Multi-Threshold Alerts Support Newline Character

For customers who use newline characters in alert conditions for better legibility, we now allow newline characters.


### Additions to ~query.*.scanned Internal Metrics

New internal metrics allow you to monitor histograms and spans. The result is the following:

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="30%">~query.summaries_scanned</td>
<td width="70%">Per-second rate at which metrics are being queried from dashboards, alerts, charts or API calls.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="30%">~query.spans_scanned</td>
<td width="70%">Per-second rate at which spans are being queried from dashboards, alerts, charts or API calls.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="30%">~query.histograms_scanned</td>
<td width="70%">Per-second rate at which histograms are being queried from dashboards, alerts, charts or API calls.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Proxy 8.0

We recently release Wavefront Proxy 7.0, which includes a significant number of new features. See [Wavefront Proxy Release Notes](proxies_versions.html).
