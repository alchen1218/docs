## Miscellaneous Improvements

### Export CSV Option

You can now export any chart to CSV, even if the chart is not in Edit mode:

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="50%">
<ol>
<li>Click a chart name to put the chart into Edit mode. </li>
<li>Select <strong>Export CSV</strong></li>.
</ol> </td>
<td width="50%"><img src="/images/export_pdf_csv.png" alt="Export PDF or CSV from chart in Edit mode"/> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">
<ol>
<li>From any dashboard, click a chart's ellipsis menu. </li>
<li>Select <strong>Export CSV</strong> to export the chart's content.</li>
</ol> </td>
<td width="50%"><img src="/images/export_csv_chart.png" alt="Export PDF from chart"/></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Additions to ~query.*.scanned Internal Metrics

New internal metrics allow you to monitor histograms and spans. The result is the following:

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="30%">~query.summaries_scanned</td>
<td width="70%">Per-second rate at which metrics are being queried from dashboards, alerts, charts or API calls.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="30%">~query.spans_scanned</td>
<td width="70%">Per-second rate at which spans are being queried from dashboards, alerts, charts or API calls.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="30%">~query.histograms_scanned</td>
<td width="70%">Per-second rate at which histograms are being queried from dashboards, alerts, charts or API calls.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
