These release notes give an overview of the changes for Release 2020.30 of the Wavefront service.

<!-- ## OpenTelemetry Support in Wavefront

OpenTracing and OpenCensus have merged to form OpenTelemetry. You can use OpenTelemetry to send metrics or traces to Wavefront using the Prometheus, Jaeger, or Zipkin integration. See [OpenTelemetry]() for details.-->

## Tracing Features

### Aggregated RED Metrics

To make RED metric querying faster, Wavefront introduced [pre-aggregated RED metrics](/trace_data_details.html#aggregated-red-metrics).  Querying and aggregating service-level RED metrics can be slow due to high cardinality from operation tags, source tags, and custom tags.

### RED Metrics for Traffic

Traffic shows how applications and services interact with each other. You can visualize traffic data in charts using tracing traffic derived metrics. See [RED Metrics for Traffic](trace_data_details.html#red-metrics-for-traffic) for details.

### Tracing UI Improvements
You can now customize several aspects of the application map by using [**Map View Settings**](tracing_ui_overview.html#appmap).

## Miscellaneous Improvements

* More succinct alert notifications to Slack.
* New alert notification parameter `convertWhiteSpace`
* It's now possible to specify threshold-based coloring for a heatmap chart.
* The [`missing`](ts_missing.html) function now returns 0 or 1.


## Documentation Changes

We reorganized our tracing content to help you on-boarding faster. Take a look at the [restructured content and get on board with Wavefront distributed tracing](tracing_basics.html).
