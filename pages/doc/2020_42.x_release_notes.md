These release notes give an overview of the changes for Release 2020-42.x of the Wavefront service.

## Tracing Features

### Introducing Apdex

The [apdex score](https://www.apdex.org/overview.html) helps you understand how the response time of a service compares to the predefined response time threshold (T). Using Wavefront, you can:

* Get an overview of how the apdex score is calculated and [Configure Apdex Settings](tracing_apdex.html).
* Use [`apdex()`](apdex-function.html) to query the apdex score for your services, create charts, and create alerts.
* Use [`apdexLatency()`](apdex-function.htmll#apdexlatency-functions) to query the satisfied threshold (T) and toleration threshold (4T) of a service.

### Configure Out-of-the-Box AWS and Database Services

Wavefront can identify Java AWS services and Java databases in the application map view. See [Configure Out-of-the-Box AWS and Database Services](tracing_external_services.html#configure-out-of-the-box-aws-and-database-services) for details on configuring your OpenTracing, OpenTelemetry, or Spring Cloud Sleuth application to identify out-of-the-box external services or applications that your service communicates.

### Configure Custom External Services

In addition to the out-of-the-box Java AWS and database service, Wavefront can identify your external applications or services. See [Configure Custom External Services](tracing_external_services.html#configure-custom-external-services).


## Miscellaneous Improvements

The derived metrics feature now supports both time series metrics and histograms.
