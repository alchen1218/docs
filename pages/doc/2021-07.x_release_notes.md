These release notes give an overview of the changes for releases between 2021-02.x to 2021-07.x of the Wavefront service.

##  Delta Counter Changes

The implementation of delta counters, which was deprecated last year, will reach the end of life on April 4th, 2021. 

Wavefront migrates system dashboard and integration content. But, you have to update dashboards and metrics that use custom delta counters. See [Wavefront Obsolescence and Remediation](wavefront_obsolescence_policy.html#delta-counters) for details.

## New `mvalues()` Function

You can provide a moving time window on a time series using the moving unique values function.

The example given below gives you a moving 5-minute window on the time series grouped by the env.

```
mvalues(5m, ts(~sample.db.bytes.sent), env)
```

## `limit()` Function Supports Histograms

You can use the [limit() function](ts_limit.html) on histogram data starting with release 2021-02.x.

## Fire New PagerDuty For New source

When creating an alert, under **Advanced** settings, select **Unique PagerDuty Incidents** to receive separate PagerDuty notifications for each source that meets the alert conditions starting with the release 2021-02.x. See [Alerts](alerts.html) for details.

## Miscellaneous Improvements
