##  Delta Counter Changes

The implementation of delta counters, which was deprecated last year, will reach end of life on April 4th, 2021. 

Wavefront migrates system dashboard and integration content. But, you have to update dashboards and metrics that use custom delta counters. See [Wavefront Obsolescence and Remediation](wavefront_obsolescence_policy.html#delta-counters) for details.

## `limit()` Function Supports Histograms

Starting with release 2021-02.x, you can use the [limit() function](ts_limit.html) on histogram data.

## Create New PagerDuty Incident For Each Failing Series

Starting with the release 2021-02.x, when creating an alert, under **Advanced** settings, select **Unique PagerDuty Incidents** to receive separate PagerDuty notifications for each series that meets the alert conditions. See [Alerts](alerts.html) for details.

For example, you get separate PagerDuty notifications for both the following series because the `env` tag is different.

```
#first series
app.errors source=machine env=prod

#second series
app.errors source=machine env=stage
```

## Application permissions

Starting with release 2021-03.x, you need to be a Super Admin user or [Applications permissions](permissions_overview.html) to configure the [Apdex threshold (T)](tracing_apdex.html).

## New `mvalues()` Function

Starting with release 2021-05.x, you can provide a moving time window on a time series by using the [moving unique values function](ts_mvalues.html).

The example below gives you a moving 5-minute window on the time series grouped by the env.

```
mvalues(5m, ts(~sample.db.bytes.sent), env)
```

## Tracing Features

### Zoom In Setting on Application Map

Starting with release 2021-08.x, you can use the **Fade Labels on Zoom** setting to hide labels of small services and gradually exposes them as you zoom in on the application map. See [ Customize the application map view](tracing_ui_overview.html#appmap)

<table style="width: 100%;">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Before</th>
      <th>After</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%">
        The <b>Fade Labels on Zoom</b> setting is not selected:
        <img src="images/release_notes_without_fade_zoom.png" alt="The application map view you get if you didn't select the Fade Labels on Zoom setting.">
      </td>
