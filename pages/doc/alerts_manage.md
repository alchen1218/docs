Alerts help you find the root cause of a problem quickly.

When you receive an alert notification, the notification includes a link to the Alert Viewer, where you can drill down and examine related information. From the Alerts Browser, you can check and modify all alerts.

* In Alert Viewer, view related events, point tags, and more
* In Alerts Browser, investigate all alerts and their state, history, and more.
* In Alerts Browser, clone, edit, or delete alerts.



{% include note.html content="All users can view alerts. You need Alerts permissions to create and modify alerts. If some of the alerts in your environment are under [access control](access.html), you can view or view and modify those alerts only if they've been shared with you.  " %}


## Examine an Alert in Alert Viewer

When you receive an alert notification, it includes a link to the alert in Alert Viewer. The related information that Alert Viewer displays help you determine what's going on.

### What You Can Do

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="50%">
Get a 10-second briefing in the Alert description including:
<ul>
<li>Alert description </li>
<li>Alert settings </li>
<li>Alert targets</li>
<li>When the alert ended (if applicable)</li>
</ul>
</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">
Examine <strong>Related Firing Alerts</strong>. When an alert fires, Wavefront scans all the other alerts that have fired within 30 minutes and correlates them with the initial event using AI/ML algorithms. You can filter by alert severity.</td>
<td width="50%"><img src="/images/alert_viewer_related.png" alt="Related Firing Alerts section supports filters"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">
<strong>Affected Point Tags</strong> help you determine what is failing. When an alert fires, Wavefront analyzes the point tags that are most likely to be related to the firing alert and displays them in ranked order on the Alert Viewer. These point tags become a list of suspects for why the alert is firing. For example, if the alert is caused by an outage in region=us-west-2, Wavefront ranks this tag higher than the other tags.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%"><strong>Past Firings</strong> shows past firings with a link to the corresponding firing in the Alert Viewer. For multi-threshold alerts, you can see the severity.
</td>

### How Alert Notifications Include Links

Starting with 2020.22, the alert target mustache syntax supports 2 variables:
* The `url` variable
* The `charturl` variable

**Alert Notifications Created Before 2020.22**

For any alerts that were created before 2020.14, the `url` variable points to the alert chart. Users who click a link in an alert notification are directed to the chart.

**Alert Notifications Created in 2020.22 and later**

* Simple notification **emails** now include a **View Alert Chart** link that takes you directly to the chart view that was the link target before 2020.22.
* For Pagerduty, alert target (webhook), and  templated email notifications::
  - The link  target of the `url` mustache template variable directs to the new Alert Viewer. 
  - A new mustache context variable `chartUrl` will take you directly to the chart view that was the link target before 2020.22. 

{% include note.html content="When you upgrade to 2020.22, already-created alert targets will not be updated to use `chartUrl`. To give users the option to view the chart in Chart Editor, edit existing alert targets." %} 


## Examine All Alerts in the Alerts Browser

To view all alerts on your cluster, click the **Alerts** button to display the Alerts browser. You can use alert names or alert tags to [search or filter](wavefront_searching.html) the list of alerts. You can also filter the list by **State** and **Severity**, to view, for example, just the alerts that are both FIRING and SEVERE.

### View an Alert

The Alert browser shows the properties and current state of an alert. For example, an alert that is firing looks like this:

![Alert firing](images/alert_firing.png)

<!---
The **Firings** column shows how many times an alert changed from non-firing to firing in the last day, week, and month.
--->

### View Alert Details

To view alert details, click the chart icon in the State column in the Alerts browser. A chart displays with these queries:

- **&lt;Alert name&gt;** - the alert's Display Expression, if there is one. Otherwise, the alert condition.
- **Past Firings** - an [events() query](events_queries.html) that shows past firings of the alert.

For example, for the alert shown above, the chart displays:

![Alert queries](images/v2_alert_queries.png)


### View Alert History

Alert history shows the changes that have been made to an alert over time. To access the alert history, click the three dots to the left of the alert in the Alerts browser and click **Versions**:

![Alert queries](images/alert_history.png)


Alert history shows:
* Which user made the changes.
* The date and time the changes were made.
* A description of the changes.
You can revert back to or clone a past alert version.

You can also see at a glance [all firing alerts](alerts_states_lifecycle.html#viewing-firing-alerts) from the alert icon in the task bar.

## Clone or Delete an Alert

If you want to make copies of an existing alert, then change the copy slightly, you can clone the alert.
1. Cick the **Alerts** button to display the Alerts page.
2. Click the 3 dots to the left of the alert.

   ![Alert cloning](images/clone_alert.png)

   * To clone an alert, click **Clone**, make changes when prompted, and click **Save**.
   * To delete an alert, click **Delete** and confirm the deletion.

## Edit an Alert

You can change an alert at any time.

1. Click the **Alerts** button to display the Alerts browser.
2. Click the name of the alert you want to change to display the Edit Alert page.
3. Update the properties you want to change, and click **Save**.

## Organize Related Alerts With Alert Tags

You can use alert tags to organize related alerts into categories. Alert tags let you:
* [Search or filter](wavefront_searching.html) the list of alerts in the Alerts browser to show only a category of alerts.
* Suppress a category of alerts during a [maintenance window](maintenance_windows_managing.html).
* [Reference a group of alert metrics](alerts_dependencies.html#referencing-alert-metrics) in a single expression.

You can add a new or existing alert tag at any time:
* Set the **Tags** property when you create or edit the alert.
* Click **+** at the bottom of the alert when you view it in the Alerts browser.

For example, you might assign tags like `networkOps`, `underDevelopment`, and `eastCoast`. All users can later search for one or more of these tags to find any other alerts that are in the same category or combination of categories.

### Multi-Level Alert Tags

You can use alert tag paths for categories that have multiple levels. For example, suppose you have created a group of alerts that you use as demo examples, and:
* Within the demo group, some alerts monitor network activity, while others monitor request latency.
* Within each subgroup, some alerts monitor production applications, while others monitor development applications.

To help you manage these alerts, you assign the tag paths `example.network.prod`, `example.network.dev`, `example.latency.prod`, and `example.latency.dev`. The Alerts browser below shows the tag paths as a hierarchy under **Tag Paths** on the left. You can click **example** and then **network** to view all alerts that have a tag path that starts with `example.network`.

![Alert tag path](images/alert_tag_path.png)

In tasks such as creating a maintenance window, you can use a wildcard to match tag path components:
* `example.*.*` matches the entire group of demo alerts.
* `example.latency.*` matches all of the alerts that monitor request latency.
* `example.*.prod` matches all of the production alerts.

<!---
**Note** In simple use cases, you can organize related alerts by assigning them names that contain a common string. You can view just the related alerts by typing the common string in the search field. For example, searching for the string `Latency` might let you view alerts named `Latency Alert`, `Latency Dev Alert`, `Realtime latency`, and so on.

## Alert Events

As alerts fire, update, and resolve, [events](events.html) are created in Wavefront. You can optionally display those events as [icons](charts_events_displaying.html) on a chart's X-axis:

![event icons](images/event_icons.png)

{% include note.html content="If you don't have [access](access.html) to an alert, you also won't see the corresponding alert events." %}

## Backtesting

Wavefront can display actual firings or hypothetical alert-generated events using backtesting. Backtesting enables you to fine tune new or existing alert conditions before you save them.

When you create an alert, the Events Display is set to **Backtesting**. You can later edit the alert.

To change the events display:

1. Select the alert and click **Edit**.
2. Change the **Events Display**:
   - **Actual Firings**  - Displays past alert-generated event icons on the chart. You will see how often the alert actually fired within the given chart time window.
   - **Backtesting** - Displays hypothetical alert-generated event icons on the chart. You can see how often an alert  would fire within the chart time window based on the condition and the **Alert Fires** field.

Backtesting does not always exactly match the actual alert firing. For example, if data comes in late, backtest events won't match the actual alert firing. And even if data are meeting the alert condition for the "condition is true for x mins" amount of time, the alert itself might not fire because the alert check, determined by the alert check interval, happens too soon or too late. For both cases, backtesting shows the alert as firing while the actual alert might not show as firing.
