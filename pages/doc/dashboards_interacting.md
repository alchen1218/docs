## Common Interactions
A few interactions are common to dashboards and charts. You can isolate sources and share shortened URLs. The action buttons at the bottom right of a dashboard or chart support some of these interactions:

![action buttons](images/action_buttons.png)

### Isolating Sources and Series

When looking at charts, you can investigate a particular source or series further. Charts and dashboards have a couple of ways to do this.

**To isolate one or more sources**

Start typing the name of the sources to isolate. The fly-out supports wildcards. For example, you can search for **app-1**, **app-1\***, or **\*-1\***. When you isolate a source, series with those sources display as saturated and all other series lose color saturation.

   ![highlight sources](images/highlight_sources.png)

1. Type the name of the sources to isolate.

   ![isolated line](images/isolated_line.png)

   An isolation bar appears at the bottom of the page.

   ![isolation bar](images/isolation_bar.png)


**To isolate sources and aggregated series** you can click a series in a chart:

1. Hover over the series you want to isolate. The series you hover over display as saturated and all other series lose color saturation.
1. Click the series.  An isolation bar appears at the bottom of the page. To isolate multiple series on all charts, hold down the **Windows** or **Command** key and repeat.
   - If a series is related to a single source, it appears in the **Sources:** list. When you isolate a source, every series in the dashboard containing that source is isolated.
   - If a series represents an aggregation of sources, it appears in the **Series:** list.  When you isolate a series, the query field name displays in the isolation bar and every series in the dashboard with that query field name is isolated.

     ![isolated series](images/isolated_series.png)

**To remove a single isolation**, click the **X** icon next to the series.

**To remove all isolated sources or series** click the **X** icon next to the list label.

### Sharing Links to Dashboards and Charts

Wavefront allows you to share dashboards and charts with other authorized users of your environment. We support two options:
* Live view -- Changes as you make changes to the dashboard.
* Current view -- Links to a snapshot of what you're looking at right now.

**Note:** If access control is on, and you share a link with a user who does not have view access, the user cannot view the dashboard. You have to [share access](dashboards_interacting.html#sharing-access-to-dashboards-and-charts) before you share the link.

**To share a dashboard using a link**
1. Navigate to the dashboard and click the Share Dashboard icon.

   ![share dashboard icon](images/share_dashboard_icon.png)
2. Select the **Shared Links** tab and click the button to copy the link you want to share:

   | Share link to the LIVE display | The link recipient will see, at any time, what you see. As you make changes, the other user can see them. The time window associated with your live view URL link is based on your selection on the time bar. For example, if you select 10m, the result is a live view URL link with a 10 minute view.|
   |  Share link to the CURRENT display | The link recipient sees what you're seeing right now. Even if you make changes, the link recipient only sees the snapshot of the dashboard at the time you copied the link. |

### Sharing Access to Dashboards and Charts

If the **Security** system [preference is set](access.html#changing-the-access-control-default) to allow access to new objects to **Creator**, the following users can share dashboard access with other users and groups:
* The dashboard creator
* Super Admin
* Any user who has View & Modify access because someone already shared access to the dashboard with that user.

**To grant or revoke dashboard access**
1. Navigate to the dashboard and click the Share Dashboard icon.

   ![share dashboard icon](images/share_dashboard_icon.png)
2. Click **Users & Groups**
3. To grant access:
   1. Start typing in the **View Dashboard** or **View & Modify Dashboard** field.
   2. Select the group or user to give access to.
   3. Click **Update**
4. To revoke access, delete the group or user and click **Update**.

## Dashboard Interactions

You can customize your dashboards in many ways. Watch this video for an introduction:

<p><a href="https://vmwarelearningzone.vmware.com/oltpublish/site/openlearn.do?dispatch=previewLesson&id=5a810256-dc7a-11e7-a6ac-0cc47a352510&inner=true&player2=true"><img src="/images/v_dashboards_charts.png" style="width: 700px;"/></a>
</p>

You can perform some tasks, such as working with sections, on the dashboard itself, while other tasks such as selecting the time window, apply to every chart in the dashboard.

<a name="time_window"></a>

### Selecting Dashboard Time Windows

By default dashboards display charts with a two-hour time window with real-time data flowing in. Charts are updated every 30s and the Live Data control displays the state of the update cycle:

![live data](images/live_data.png)

You can configure the default time window in [dashboard preferences](dashboards_managing.html#prefs).

To select a larger or smaller time window or to view past data instead of realtime data, use the time bar controls to select time windows:

![time window](images/time_bar.png)

- To see up-to-date data on the charts, click **Live Data**.
- To look at past data, click **Custom Date**. When you select Custom Date, fields for a start and end time display.
- A set of time window intervals (10m, 2h, 6h, 12h, 1d, 8d)  display to the right of Live Data and Custom Date.
  - When Live Data is selected, click an interval to quickly increase or decrease the amount of live data displayed within each chart.
  - When Custom Date is selected, clicking an interval adjusts the start time based on the end time. For example, if your end time is 3:00 PM and you choose 12h, the start time is adjusted to 3:00 AM.


### Working with Sections

Dashboard [sections](dashboards_managing.html#configuring-dashboard-sections) allow you to group saved charts in a meaningful way. By default, every dashboard has at least one section. The section link bar is located directly below the time bar.

![section toc](images/section_links.png)

**To jump to any section** on a dashboard, click the section name in the section link bar.

**To toggle whether a section is expanded or collapsed**, click the section name. All sections are expanded when you first display a dashboard.

### Displaying Events on Charts

The **Show Events** dropdown (with **From Chart** <i class="fa fa-caret-down"/> selected) in the middle of the time bar allows you to overlay [events](charts_events_displaying.html) on the X-axis of charts.

![time window](images/time_bar.png)

See [Controlling Event Overlays](charts_events_displaying.html#controlling-events-overlays).

### Performing Temporary Global Queries

Suppose you would like to apply a temporary ts() expression to every chart to help identify when the time series in a set of charts cross a threshold. For example, you have a dashboard that tracks errors per second across several applications and drawing a temporary constant 5 across every chart helps you to see which applications have the highest number of errors. Instead of permanently applying a constant value of 5 to every chart, you can use the Global Query fly-out. Global queries allow you to temporarily apply any ts() expression to every chart on a dashboard. For example:

- A constant value such as 5
- A simple ts() expression such as `ts(~metrics.counter)`
- An advanced ts() expression such as `(ts(mem.total) - ts(mem.free)) * 100`

To apply a global query:

1. Hover over the Global Query fly-out (**+**) icon in the action buttons at the bottom right corner of a dashboard.
1. Specify a ts() expression, for example, 5:

   ![global query flyout](images/global_query_flyout.png)

1. Press **Enter** or **Return**. For the query 5, every chart displays a temporary constant time series 5:

   ![global query](images/global_query.png)

The Global Query fly-out stays out until you remove the query expression.

### Opening a Chart

To open a chart, click the chart name in the upper right corner.

![chart title](images/chart_title.png)

In the chart editor, you can modify and add chart queries and display properties.

## Selecting Chart Time Windows

You can select time windows for individual charts in a few different ways.

### Time Bar

The chart time bar ![chart time bar](images/chart_time_bar.png#inline) displays in the upper-right corner of a chart when you hover over the chart. The magnifying lenses allow you to quickly increase or decrease the time window. You can also adjust the time window by clicking 2h, 6h, 12h, 1d, or 8d.

### Displaying Live Data

If the chart is not displaying live data, a <span style="color:#8B0000">GO LIVE</span> <i class="fa fa-play-circle" style="color:#8B0000"/> link displays to the left of the time bar.

![chart_name_corner](images/chart_name_corner.png)

Click the link to display live data.

### Zooming In

Here's a shorcut for zooming into a time window:

1. Hover over a chart and place your cursor at the beginning of the desired time window. In the chart below, this would be 12:00 PM.
1. Left click and hold while dragging over the desired time window. A blue box appears over the desired time window.
1. At the desired end point, 12:05 PM in the chart below, release the mouse button. The highlighted time window expands to fill your chart.

To zoom into to all charts on a dashboard, hold down the **Shift** key while selecting the window.

![drag and zoom](images/drag_zoom.png)

### Shifting the Time Window

You can shift the time window of a single chart by shifting the X-axis.

1. Place your cursor over the X-axis until your cursor changes to a 4-way arrow <i class="fa fa-arrows"/>.
1. Click and hold while dragging your cursor to the left to shift the time window or the focus into the past, or to the right to shift the time window into the future.

  You can move the time window into the future, however, unless you are using one of the [predictive functions](query_language_reference.html#predictive-functions), the data you see won't be predictive.

To shift the time windows of all charts on a dashboard, hold down the **Shift** key while dragging.

### Propagating and Resetting Time Windows

Whenever you adjust the time window of a single chart, you can easily propagate that window to every other chart on the dashboard or reset the individual chart to match all of the other time windows.

To propagate a chart time window to all other charts on the dashboard, click the share icon <i class="fa fa-share-square-o" /> that appears directly under the chart name in the top right corner of the chart box.

To reset the individual chart window to match all other charts, click **RESET**: ![reset time window](images/reset_time_window.png#inline)


## Activating Chart Display Modes
Charts support a few modes for controlling how data displays. You can display data in full precision mode, hide the hover legend, and display a fish-eye view. These features are enabled using  Shift, Ctrl, and Alt or Option hot keys.

### Full-Precision Mode
To display data in full-precision mode in the hover legend, hold down the **Shift** key and hover over any chart:

![full precision](images/full_precision.png)

### Hide Hover Legend
To hide the hover legend when hovering over a chart, hold down the **Ctrl** key. For charts that include a hover legend by default, you can permanently disable the hover legend under the Legend tab in the individual chart view.

### Fish-Eye View
When data streams are populated very densely, it can be hard to tell the exact value of each series. The fish-eye view expands the chart in the neighborhood of the cursor. To enable fish-eye view, hold down the **Alt** or **Option** key while you hover over a chart.

![fish eye](images/fish_eye.png)

When using this feature, the vertical and horizontal lines are preserved.
