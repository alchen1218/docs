summary: Learn how to send data directly to the Wavefront service.
---

You use the direct data ingestion mechanism to send data directly to the Wavefront service instead of a proxy. While the Wavefront proxy has many [benefits](proxies.html#proxy-benefits), direct data ingestion can be the best approach for some use cases.

## Background

Wavefront currently expects that your host, application, or custom code send metrics to a Wavefront proxy installed in your environment. The proxy forwards metrics to the Wavefront service. In production environments, two proxies behind a load balancer guarantee availability and prevent data loss.

Because some customers told us they'd like to send data directly to the Wavefront service, we're now making this functionality available.

## Example Commands

The following examples illustrate how to send data to Wavefront.
* An [API token](wavefront_api.html#generating-an-api-token) is required. Referred to as `<<TOKEN>>` in the examples.
* You must know your Wavefront domain name. These examples use `mydomain.wavefront.com`.
* Currently, we support only [Wavefront Data Format](wavefront_data_format.html), which is named `wavefront`. If you don't specify `f=wavefront`, we still use that format.

### Multiple Data Points

Assume `wavefront.txt` contains 1 or more lines in the Wavefront data format. You can send it to Wavefront like this:

```
cat wavefront.txt | curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <<TOKEN>>" -F file=@- https://mydomain.wavefront.com/report
```

### Single Data Point

You can send a single data point like this:
```
echo "hello.world 1 source=<myhost>" | curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <<TOKEN>>" --data @- https://mydomain.wavefront.com/report
```

### Histogram Distribution

You can perform direct ingestion of [histogram distributions](proxies_histograms.html#sending-histogram-distributions) in histogram distribution format. You cannot perform direct ingestion of histogram data in Wavefront data format.

Here's a simple example:
```
echo '!M #20 30 #10 5 request.latency source=appServer1 region=us-west' | curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <<TOKEN>>" --data @- https://mydomain.wavefront.com/report?f=histogram
```

Note that:
* The histogram feature requires a separate license and is not enabled on your cluster by default.
* You enclose the distribution in single quotes and use the [histogram distribution format](proxies_histograms.html#sending-histogram-distributions).
* You must include `f=histogram` to ensure the input is treated as a histogram distribution.

## Comparing Proxy and Direct Ingestion

Direct ingestion has some benefits, but also some limitations:

* No disk queueing
* No rate limiting
* No blacklist or whitelist
* No preprocessor
* Only Wavefront data format is currently supported. No support for OpenTSB, JSON, and Pickle
* No support for log ingestion

Some limitations, for example supported data formats, might be resolved in the future, but other limitations are benefits of the Wavefront proxy.
