<!--
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td markdown="span">**Access management**</td>
<td>By default, Wavefront users can access objects based on their permissions. Wavefront allows administrators to limit access to Wavefront objects (initially dashboards). With this strict security setting, only the creator (e.g. dashboard creator) and invited users/groups have access to new objects.
</td>

<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td markdown="span">[**Alert**](alerts.html)</td>
<td markdown="span">An alert defines the *condition* under which metric values indicate a system problem and one or more *alert targets*. When the condition evaluates to true or false for a specified period of time, the alert sends an alert notification to the alert target(s).
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td markdown="span">Alert notification</td>
<td markdown="span">When an alert fires, Wavefront sends an alert notification to the alert target you specified when you created the alert. You can [customize **alert notifications**](alert_target_customizing.html).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td markdown="span">Alert target</td>
<td markdown="span">Specifies when and how to send notifications in response to alert activity. You can use our built-in alert targets by specifying an email address or a PagerDuty key in the alert, or you can create a [**custom alert target**](webhooks_alert_notification.html).</td>

<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td markdown="span">Bucket size</td>
<td markdown="span">In Wavefront charts, point buckets represent data that have been summarized over a certain length of time. [**Chart resolution**](charts_customizing.html#chart-resolution) is the bucket time interval, and it displays in the Horizontal Scale field in the lower-left corner of a chart.</td>
</tr>

<td><strong><big>C</big></strong></td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td markdown="span">[**Chart**](charts.html)</td>
<td markdown="span">Charts allow you to view and examine your telemetry data. Wavefront supports a rich set of chart types and chart configuration options. You can interact directly with charts–-zoom in, zoom out, change the time window, and so on, and share a link to the chart. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td markdown="span">&nbsp;</td>
<td markdown="span">Collector agent</td>
<td>Many Wavefront customers set up their environment to use a collector agent such as Telegraf for data collection. The collector agent sends the metrics to the Wavefront proxy. We support integrations for commonly used collector agents. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td markdown="span">&nbsp;</td>
<td markdown="span">[**Continuous time series**](query_language_reference.html#discrete-versus-continuous-time-series)</td>
<td>A time series that contains one data point per second. Because Wavefront accepts and stores data at up to 1 second resolution, a continuous time series has a data value for each moment in time that can be represented on the X-axis of a chart. <strong>See also:</strong> Discrete time series.</td>

<tr>
<td><strong><big>D</big></strong></td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td markdown="span">[**Dashboard**](dashboards.html)</td>
