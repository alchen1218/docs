summary: Learn how to send data emitted by New Relic to Wavefront.
---
[New Relic](https://www.newrelic.com/) is a popular APM solution for monitoring applications. The Wavefront collector supports pulling metrics from New Relic at least every minute. Application summary data can be polled every 30s, but is not guaranteed by New Relic to be updated that often.


## Requirements
 - The New Relic user must be an [admin](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/api-keys#key-types).
 - Python 2.7+

## Installation

```shell
$ pip install wavefront_collector
$ mkdir -p /opt/wavefront/etc/
```

## Configuration

1. Download the sample configuration files from [wavefront-integrations-tool](https://github.com/wavefront-mike/wavefront-collector/tree/master/data/newrelic-sample-configuration) and place them into `/opt/wavefront/etc`.
1. Open `/opt/wavefront/etc/newrelic-summary.conf` and `/opt/wavefront/etc/newrelic-details.conf`.
  1. Set the `key` in the `api` section.
  1. Set the `application_ids` in the `filter` section.
  1. Set the `host` and `dry_run` values in the `writer` section when ready to test.  Leave `dry_run = True` to test what would be sent to the proxy.  While `dry_run = True` run the script in the foreground so you can see the output and press **Ctrl-C** to stop execution.
1. Update other [configuration options](#proxy-configuration) as desired.
1. Save the files.

## Running the Script
The main script is `wf` (which is a symlink to `wave.py`).  It is installed by `pip` in `/usr/local/bin` on most systems.

### Command Line Options

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Option</th><th>Description</th><th>Default</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>--config FILE</td>
<td>Full path to the configuration file</td>
<td>/opt/wavefront/etc/wavefront-collector.conf</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


### Execute

```shell
$ wf --config /opt/wavefront/etc/wavefront-collector.conf
```

### Service Script
You can also run this as a service.  A service script (`/usr/local/bin/wavefront-collector`) is provided in the pip installer. This script can be run with:

```shell
$ wavefront-collector [(start|stop|status|restart)]
```
This script assumes that you have `/opt/wavefront/etc/wavefront-collector.conf` (and is updated according to earlier steps).

### Log Files

The default log file location is `/tmp/wavefront-collector.log`.  This can be changed by editing the `/opt/wavefront/etc/wavefront-collector.conf` file.

### Caching
The responses from `*/metrics.json` API calls (the API that gets a list of metric names that are available) are cached for a day in `/tmp/wfnrcache`.  One file is stored here per API path.  The file is named by the MD5 of the API path.

## Configuration Options
The default configuration files provided should be sufficient, but all configuration options available are documented here.  Configuration is retrieved from and stored in an INI-formatted file with multiple sections.  Each section is described in more detail below.

This configuration file also acts as a fileconfig for the logger.  See <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.config.html#logging.config.fileConfig">fileConfig definition</a> for more details on how to configure logging.

## Standard Configuration

- `wavefront-collector.conf`
  - Runs the script as a daemon with the PID file stored in the current working directory (`./newrelic.pid`) and the stdout/stderr in `./newrelic.out`.
  - Runs 2 threads: one for processing the summary and one for the details.
- `summary.conf`
  - Gets the application summary every 30s (no details are retrieved so the summary metrics can be updated more frequently)
- `details.conf`
  - Gets the application (host) details and delays 5m between each run.
