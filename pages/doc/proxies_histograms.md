Wavefront histograms let you compute, store, and use distributions of metrics rather than single metrics. Histograms are useful for high-velocity metrics about your applications and infrastructure – particularly those gathered across many distributed sources. You can send histograms to a Wavefront proxy or use direct ingestion.

## Getting Started

Watch this video for an introduction to histograms:

The following blog posts give some background information:
* [What if I Told You Your Monitoring Data is Lying: Why Histograms are Critical for Accurate Reporting of Hi-Velocity Metrics](https://www.wavefront.com/why-histograms-critical-for-reporting-hi-velocity-metrics/)
* [How the Metric Histogram Type Works: True Visibility into High-Velocity Application Metrics](https://www.wavefront.com/metric-histogram-type-works-true-visibility-high-velocity-application-metrics-part-2-2-2-2/)





## Why Use Histograms?

Wavefront can receive and store highly granular metrics at 1 point per second per unique source. However, some scenarios generate even higher frequency data. Suppose you are measuring the latency of web requests. If you have a lot of traffic at multiple servers, you may have multiple distinct measurements for a given metric,
timestamp, and source. Using "normal" metrics, we can't measure this because, rather than metric-timestamp-source mapping to a single value, the composite key maps to a [multiset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiset) (multiple and possibly duplicate values).

One approach to dealing with high frequency data is to calculate an aggregate statistic, such as a percentile, at each source and send only that data. The problem with this approach is that performing an aggregate of a percentile (such as
a 95th percentile from a variety of sources) does not yield an accurate and valid percentile with high velocity metrics. That might mean that even though you have an outlier in some of the source data, it becomes obscured by all the other data.

To address high frequency data, Wavefront supports histograms -- a mechanism to compute, store, and use distributions of metrics. A Wavefront histogram is a distribution of metrics collected and computed by the Wavefront proxy (4.12 and later), or sent to the Wavefront service via direct ingestion. To indicate that metrics should be treated as histogram data, the user must either:
* Send the metrics to a [histogram proxy port](#histogram-proxy-ports) instead of the normal metrics port (2878).
* Specify `f=histogram` as part of the [direct ingestion command](direct_ingestion.html#histogram-distribution).

The Wavefront service [rewrites the names of histogram metrics](#histogram-metric-names), which you can query with a set of [functions](#histogram-functions).

## Wavefront Histogram Distributions

Wavefront creates distributions by aggregating metrics into bins. The following figure illustrates a distribution of 205 points that range in value from 0 to 120 at t = 1 minute, into bins of size 10.

![histogram](images/histogram.png)

The following table lists the distribution of one metric at successive minutes. The first row of the table contains the distribution illustrated in the figure. The following rows show how the distribution evolves over successive minutes.

<table width="100%">
<colgroup>
<col width="40%" />
<col width="60%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr><th>Time (minute)</th><th>Distribution (number of points)</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>[2, 1, 9, 20, 31, 40, 40, 29, 19, 10, 2, 2]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>[2, 1, 9, 22, 31, 38, 41, 28, 17, 11, 3, 2]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>[1, 2, 10, 21, 31, 39, 40, 29, 19, 10, 1, 2]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>[2, 1, 9, 19, 29, 40, 41, 31,  20, 10, 1, 2]</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


The Wavefront histogram bin size is computed using a [T-digest algorithm](https://github.com/tdunning/t-digest/blob/master/docs/t-digest-paper/histo.pdf), which retains better accuracy at the distribution edges where outliers typically arise. In the algorithm, bin size is not uniform (unlike the histogram illustrated above). However, the bin size that the algorithm selects is irrelevant.

Wavefront histograms do not store each actual data point value that is fed to it. Instead, histograms store the quantiles calculated from histogram points, which are estimates within a certain margin of error.


## Histogram Metric Aggregation Intervals

Wavefront supports aggregating metrics by the minute, hour, or day. Intervals start and end on the minute, hour, or day, depending on the granularity that you choose. For example, day-long intervals start at the beginning of each day, UTC time zone.

The aggregation intervals do not overlap.  If you are aggregating by the minute, a value reported at 13:58:37 is assigned to the interval `[13:58:00;13:59:00]`. If no metrics are sent during an interval, no histogram points are recorded.

## Sending Histogram Distributions

A distribution allows you to send multiple points with a single value.

To send histogram data as a distribution to the Wavefront proxy:

- Send to the **distribution** port listed in the table in [Histogram Proxy Ports](#histogram-proxy-ports).

- Use the following format:

  ```
  {!M | !H | !D} [<timestamp>] #<points> <metricValue> [... #<points> <metricValue>]
   <metricName> source=<source> <pointTagKey1>=<value1> ... <pointTagKeyn>=<valuen>
  ```

  where
  * `{!M | !H | !D}` identifies the aggregation interval (minute, hour, or day) used when computing the distribution
  * `points` is the number of points.

  For example:

  ```
  !M 1493773500 #20 30 #10 5 request.latency source=appServer1 region=us-west
  ```

  is a distribution that sends 20 points of the metric `request.latency` with value 30 and 10 points with value 5, that have been aggregated into minute intervals.

  {% include note.html content="Unlike the Wavefront data format, which is `<metricName> <metricValue> <timestamp>`, histogram data format inverts the ordering of components in a data point: `<timestamp> #<points> <metricValue> <metricName>`." %}

You can also send a histogram distribution using [direct ingestion](direct_ingestion.html#histogram-distribution). In that case, you must include `f=histogram` or your data are treated as metrics even if you use histogram format.

## Histogram Example

Suppose you want to send the following points to the Wavefront proxy:

10, 20, 20, 30, 40, 100, 100

If you want an hourly aggregation, you can send those points as a distribution to the histogram distribution listener port (by default 40000):

`!H <timestamp> #1 10 #2 20 #1 30 #2 100 my.metric source=s1`

Here, you specify:
* the interval, in this case hours (!H)
* timestamp (optional)
* a set of sequences. Each sequence starts with #, followed by the number of points and the value of the points. In this example, we have 2 for 20 and 100 because we’re sending that point twice.
* metric name
* source
* optional point tag keys and values

You can also send the histogram data to one of the histogram proxy ports in [Wavefront data format](wavefront_data_format.html). For this example, we use the hour port (40002). You have to send each point separately and include a timestamp, and all points have to arrive within the hour. For example, if you sent a point in the range 3:00-3:59 with !H, it shows at 3:00 with an `hs()` query.

```
my.metric 10 <t1> <source>
my.metric 20 <t2> <source>
my.metric 20 <t3> <source>
my.metric 30 <t4> <source>
my.metric 40 <t5> <source>
my.metric 100 <t6> <source>
my.metric 100 <t7> <source>
```

The proxy aggregates the points and sends only the histogram distribution to Wavefront. The Wavefront service knows only what each bin is and how many points are in each bin. Wavefront does not store the value of each single histogram point, it computes and stores the quantiles.

You can now apply other functions to the histogram, for example, you can try to find out what the 85th percentile of the histogram is. For this example, you could now write a query like this:

`percentile (85, hs(my.metric))`

## Histogram Configuration

Histograms are supported by Wavefront proxy 4.12 and later. To use histograms, ensure that your data is in histogram format, and set the [histogram proxy port](#histogram-proxy-ports) to send to. Different ports accept different data formats, as shown in the table below. For information on how to configure proxies, see [Advanced Proxy Configuration](proxies_configuring.html).


### Histogram Proxy Ports

To indicate that you are sending histogram data, send the metrics to one of the histogram proxy ports. You can use 40000 for sending a distribution or select one of the other ports to sending an aggregation interval. For example:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="30%" />
<col width="30%" />
<col width="15%" />
<col width="25%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr><th>Aggregation Interval or Distribution</th><th>Proxy Property</th><th>Default Value</th><th>Data Ingestion Format</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>distribution</td>
<td>histogramDistListenerPorts</td>
<td>40000</td>
<td><a href="#sending-histogram-distributions">Distribution data format</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>minute</td>
<td>histogramMinuteListenerPorts</td>
<td>40001</td>
<td><a href="/wavefront_data_format.html">Wavefront data format</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>hour</td>
<td>histogramHourListenerPorts</td>
<td>40002</td>
<td><a href="/wavefront_data_format.html">Wavefront data format</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>day</td>
<td>histogramDayListenerPorts</td>
<td>40003</td>
<td><a href="/wavefront_data_format.html">Wavefront data format</a></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

You can send [**Wavefront data format**](wavefront_data_format.html) histogram data only to a minute, hour, or day port.
* If you send Wavefront data format histogram data to the distribution port, the points are rejected as invalid input format and logged.
* If you send Wavefront data format histogram data to port 2878 (instead of a min, hour, or day port), the data is not ingested as histogram data but as regular Wavefront data format metrics.

You can send [**distribution data format**](#sending-histogram-distributions) histogram data only to the distribution port. If you send Wavefront distribution data format to `min`, `hour`, or `day` ports, the points are rejected as invalid input format and logged.

### Histogram Configuration Properties

Wavefront supports additional histogram configuration properties, shown in the following table. Note the requirements on the state directory and the effect of the two `persist` properties listed at the bottom of the table.

## Querying Histogram Metrics

Wavefront follows specific naming conventions for histogram metrics and defines functions to query and summarize histogram metrics.

### Histogram Metric Naming

You send metrics using the standard [Wavefront data format](wavefront_data_format.html):

```html
<metricName> <metricValue> [<timestamp>] source=<source> <pointTagKey1>=<value1> ... <pointTagKeyn>=<valuen>
```

For example, `request.latency 20 1484877771 source=<source>`.

The Wavefront proxy adds the suffixes `.m`, `.h`, or `.d` to the metric name according to the aggregation interval. For example, if the metric `request.latency` is aggregated over an hour, the metric will be named: `request.latency.h`.

### Histogram Functions

To query histogram metrics, use `hs()` queries.

You can apply the following functions to the returned data&mdash; `percentile`,  `max`, `min`, `median`, `merge`,  `align`, and `count`. For example:

* `percentile(<percentile>, hs(<histogramMetricName>.m))`-- Returns `<histogramMetricName>` for the `<percentile>` percentile aggregated over a minute.
* `max(hs(<histogramMetricName>.m))` -- Returns the largest value in `<histogramMetricName>`
* `median(hs(<histogramMetricName>.m))` -- Returns the median of `<histogramMetricName>`
* `merge(hs(<histogramMetricName>.m))` -- Merges the centroids and counts of each series and returns the aggregated result `<histogramMetricName>`. Because this is an aggregation function, you can also group by point tags. ie: `merge(hs(<histogramMetricName>.m),key)` where `key` is a point tag name.
* `align(<timeWindow>,hs(<histogramMetricName>.m))` -- Allows the user to merge histograms across time buckets. For example, use `align(1h, hs(<histogramMetricName>.m))` to output hourly buckets on a minutely histogram.
* `count(hs(<histogramMetricName>.m))` –- Returns the number of values in a distribution.

{% include note.html content="Direct histogram visualization in charts is not currently supported. By default, charts display `median(hs(...))`. You can change the displayed function by explicitly wrapping the `hs()` function with one of the supported functions listed above, for example, `max(hs(...))`." %}

## Viewing Histogram Metrics

Starting with release 2018.42, you can view histograms in the Histogram browser if you're cluster is licensed for that feature.

To view histograms:
1. Click **Browse > Histograms** and start typing the histogram metric name.
  Each histogram metric has an extension .d, .h, or .m. If you sent a metric in histogram format, three metrics result. If you sent a metric using Wavefront data format, the extension depends on the histogram port that you used.
2. Select the metric you're interested in.

   ![select_histogram_chart](images/histogram_select_chart.png)
3. Examine the chart.
   * The query is an `hs()` query, not a `ts()` query.
   * We display the median for histogram metrics by default. You can use  `percentile(<value>, hs(<expression>))` to retrieve other percentiles.

   ![histogram_chart](images/histogram_chart.png)

## Monitoring Histogram Points

You can use `~collector` metrics to monitor histogram ingestion. See [Understanding ~collector Metrics for Histograms](wavefront_monitoring.html#understanding-collector-metrics-for-histograms).
