In most cases, a Wavefront proxy must be running in your installation before metrics begin streaming to Wavefront from a host or application.

## Scripted and Manual Install

You can install a proxy:
* As part of an. Even collector agent integrations, such as the Telegraf integration, install a proxy.
* Explicitly from the UI, discussed below.
* Explicitly as a package install. [Installing a proxy manually](proxies_manual_install.html) gives steps for different use cases, including install on hosts with limited network connectivity.
* If you install a proxy into a container, you might have to [customize your setup](proxies_configuring.html#configuring-a-proxy-in-a-container).

If you don't use the Wavefront UI to install the proxy, the installation procedures might require a Wavefront API URL `<wavefront_api_url>` in the format `https://<wavefront_instance>.wavefront.com/api/` and an API token. To get an API token, see [Generating an API Token](wavefront_api.html#generating-an-api-token).

**Note** Some installation procedures automatically configure these properties for you.

## Proxy Host Requirements

- Internet access - run `timeout 3s curl -fIsS <wavefront_api_url>` from the host and make sure you get a response and not a timeout.
- Networking - For **metrics**, the proxy uses port 2878 by default. If you want to change this default, or if you want to set up ports for histograms or trace data, see [Configuring Listener Ports for Metrics, Histograms, and Traces](proxies_installing.html#configuring-listener-ports-for-metrics-histograms-and-traces).
- Memory - you don't need a dedicated host for running the Wavefront proxy. The proxy does not use a lot of CPU, memory, or storage. However, we recommend running the proxy on a host with at least 4GB of free memory.
- Operating system
  - Linux
    - Ubuntu 14.04, 16.04, 18.04
    - CentOS 6.5, 7
    - RHEL 6, 7
    - Debian 7, 8, 9, 10
    - Amazon Linux
  - Mac - MacOS Sierra (10.12)
  - Windows - Windows 8 and later

You can also run a proxy in a [Docker or Kubernetes container](proxies_configuring.html#configuring-a-proxy-in-a-container).

## Proxy Installation

If we don't install a proxy for you as part of integration setup, you can install a proxy explicitly. You can script installation on Linux and Mac OS. You can also run a proxy in a Docker container.

**Note**: You can use a single proxy to pass input from many collector agents to the Wavefront service. In production, consider using two proxies behind a load balancer. See [Proxy Deployment Options](proxies.html#proxy-deployment-options).

### Installing a Proxy on a Single Host
To install and run a proxy on a Linux, Mac, or Windows host, or in a Docker container on a host:

1. Open the Wavefront application UI.
1. Select **Browse > Proxies**.
1. Select **Add > New Proxy** at the top of the filter bar.
1. Click the **\[Linux \| Mac \| Windows \| Docker ]** tab.
1. (Windows Only) Download the proxy.
1. Copy the script and run it on your host.

   **Note** On Windows, do not run the installer `.exe` file. Run the script instead.
1. After the proxy contacts the Wavefront service, the proxy name displays under "Checking for new proxies..." and the button label changes to **Done**.
1. Click **Done** and verify that your proxy is listed on the Proxies page. If not, follow the steps in [Managing Proxy Services](#managing-proxy-services) to start the proxy is running.

If you want to run a proxy in a Kubernetes container, log in to Wavefront, click **Integrations**, click Kubernetes, click the **Setup** tab, and follow the instructions to deploy a Wavefront proxy in Kubernetes, create a proxy service, and deploy Wavefront Kubernetes Collector.

### Scripted Proxy Installation

In Linux hosts, you can use the [Wavefront CLI](wavefront_cli.html) to install the Wavefront proxy and to perform certain management tasks.

In Mac and Linux hosts, you can select the integration for the host and run only the command that installs the proxy, not the command that installs the Telegraf agent.

## Managing Proxy Services

After installing a proxy, you can start and stop the proxy service, check service status, and view the logs that are generated by the service. See [Logging](proxies_configuring.html#logging) for log configuration options.

### Starting and Stopping a Proxy

You can start and stop a proxy by running the following commands on the proxy host:

- Linux

  ```
  $ service wavefront-proxy [start | stop | restart]
  ```
- Mac

  ```
  $ brew services [start | stop | restart] wfproxy
  ```
- Docker

  ```
  $ docker [start | stop ] <proxy_container_id>
  ```
- Windows

  ```
  $ cd C:\Program Files (x86)\Wavefront\bin
  $ ./nssm.exe [start | stop] WavefrontProxy
  ```

### Checking Proxy Service Status

To check if the proxy is running, run the following commands on the proxy host:

- Linux

  ```shell
  $ service wavefront-proxy status
  ```
  You can view the proxy log at `/var/log/wavefront/wavefront.log`.
- Mac

  ```shell
  $ brew services list
  ```
  You can view the proxy log at `/usr/local/var/log/wavefront/wavefront.log`.

- Windows

  ```
  $ cd C:\Program Files (x86)\Wavefront\bin
  $ ./nssm.exe status WavefrontProxy
  ```
  You can view the proxy log at `Program Files (x86)\Wavefront\wavefront.log`.

- Docker

  ```
  $ docker ps
  ```
  To view the proxy log, run `docker logs <proxy_container_id>`.

### Configuring Listener Ports for Metrics, Histograms, and Traces

The proxy listens on different ports for different kinds of data. These ports are specified in the [proxy configuration file](proxies_configuring.html#proxy-configuration-properties).

* **For metrics**, you do not need to edit this file if you plan to ingest metrics using the default port (2878).
* **For histogram distributions or trace data**, you must edit this file, uncomment the port properties, and restart the proxy. You can optionally set nondefault port numbers.

You set the following properties to configure proxy ports:

* For **metrics**, set `pushListenerPorts`. Required only if you want to change to a port other than 2878.
* For **histograms**, set `histogramDistListenerPorts` for data in histogram format. The recommended port number is 2878 (proxy 4.29 and later) or 40000 (earlier proxy versions). See [Histogram Proxy Ports](proxies_histograms.html#histogram-proxy-ports) for port numbers for histograms in Wavefront data format.
* For **trace data**, set `traceListenerPorts`.  The recommended port number is 30000.

**Note:** If you are instrumenting your application with a Wavefront SDK to send data to the proxy, make sure the proxy's port settings match the port numbers you specify during SDK setup.

### Testing a Proxy

You can test that a proxy is receiving and sending data as follows:

1. Run the following command:

   ```shell
echo -e "test.metric 1 source=test_host\n" | nc <wavefront_proxy_address> 2878
   ```
   where `<wavefront_proxy_address>` is the address of your Wavefront proxy.
1. In the Wavefront UI, select **Browse > Metrics**.
1. In the Metrics field, type `test.metric`.
1. Click `test.metric` to display a chart of the metric.

### Upgrading a Proxy

Wavefront releases new proxy versions with new features periodically. See [Proxy Release Notes](proxies_versions.html)

To upgrade the environment, you can select **Browse > Proxies > Add New Proxy**. If an older version of the proxy exists, this process replaces it.

**Note** On Windows systems, you might have to uninstall the existing proxy first. Use the uninstall process for **Wavefront Proxy** on the Windows system you're using.


For Linux and Mac OS, can also upgrade a proxy from the command line as follows:

Linux| `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install wavefront-proxy`
Linux (RPM)|`yum update wavefront-proxy`
Mac OS|`brew update && brew upgrade wfproxy`

### Uninstalling a Proxy

When you upgrade a proxy, we uninstall the older version for you. You can also uninstall a proxy explicitly. The process is different for different operating systems.
