* Information about changes to proxy is now in Github on the **[Wavefront proxy github page](https://github.com/wavefrontHQ/java/releases)**. On that page, you can also see which version of the proxy is GA or a release candidate.
* This doc set used to have a summary for each release. This summary information is now in the [Wavefront Proxy Release Notes Archive](proxies_versions_archived.html). Going forward, the Github page is the single source of truth.
