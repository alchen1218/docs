summary: Learn how to query for Wavefront trace data.
---

After your application sends [trace data](tracing_basics.html#wavefront_trace_data) to Wavefront, you can query that data from the **Traces** page. With a trace query, you find the traces that you're interested in by describing the spans they must contain.

## Understanding Trace Queries

You query for traces by describing the spans they must contain. A trace query can specify various span characteristics, such as an operation name, duration thresholds, and values for the tags that you set up when you instrumented your application. 

When you submit a trace query, it:
1. Finds the spans that match the description you specify.
2. Returns the traces that contain one or more qualifying spans. 

For example, you can use a trace query to return traces that contain at least one span that meets all of the following criteria: 
* Is longer than 45 milliseconds.
* Represents an operation called `dispatch` that is performed by a service called `delivery`.
* Represents work done on a cluster called `us-west-2`.
* Is associated with a custom tag `env=production`.

A returned trace might contain other spans that do not meet these criteria. 

### Graphic Representation of a Returned Trace

Each returned trace is shown graphically as a bar. The bar's length represents the trace's duration. The bar's color indicates whether the trace has an error in one or more spans (red) or has no reported errors (blue):

### How Wavefront Labels a Returned Trace

Each bar that is returned by a query represents a unique trace that has a unique trace ID. For readability, we label each trace using the operation that its root span represents. The root span is the first span in the trace.  For example, each of the two returned traces shown above has a root span that represents the work done by the `orderShirts` operation in the `shopping` service, so the label for each of these traces is **shopping: orderShirts**. Although these root spans have the same operation name, they represent distinct executions of the `orderShirts` operation, with different start times.

**Note:** A label such as **shopping: orderShirts** refers to the root span of a trace, which may be different from the span that was specified in the query. For example, suppose you query for spans that represent `dispatch` operations. The query could return traces that begin with `orderShirts`, if those traces contain one or more `dispatch` spans. 

### Limiting the Result Set

To prevent a trace query from taking a long time, you normally specify a limit on the number of spans that can be matched. After reaching the limit, the query stops looking for more matching spans. 

**Note:** The limit applies to the number of spans that a query matches, and not to the number of traces that the query returns. For example, say you limit a query to 20 spans. If 2 or more qualified spans belong to the same trace, that trace is shown only once, and you will see fewer than 20 traces in the result set.


## Submitting Trace Queries

You submit queries and view the results on the **Traces** page. 

To navigate to **Traces** directly:

* Click **Applications > Traces** in the task bar.

  **Note:** Alternatively, you can navigate to the **Traces** page from any page that displays metrics for a service.

Wavefront provides assistance for constructing and submitting a trace query:
* Query Builder: Use menus to select tag values for filtering spans.
    ![tracing query builder](images/tracing_query_builder.png)

* Query Editor: Type a [`spans()` query](spans_queries.html), and take advantage of syntax completion for selecting tags and their values. 
    ![tracing query editor](images/tracing_query_editor.png) 


To enable the level of query assistance you want: 

1. Display the **Traces** page.
2. Click this icon to toggle between Query Builder and Query Editor.

## Building a Trace Query

Query Builder lets you use menus for selecting values that describe the spans you want to see. Certain menus correspond to tags that a developer specified while instrumenting the application code. An empty menu means that the code was instrumented without the corresponding tags.

1. Display the **Traces** page and make sure Query Builder is displayed. (It is displayed by default.)
2. Select a value from one or more of the menus. At a minimum you must select an application from the Operation menu. 

    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col width="20%"/>
    <col width="80%"/>
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr><th>Menu</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td markdown="span">**Operation**</td>
    <td>Match spans that represent work done by the selected operation. If you instrumented the code with application tags, this menu cascades so you can find spans that represent the work done by:
      <ul>
      <li> All operations in all services in a selected application.</li>
      <li> All operations in a selected service and application.</li>
      <li> A selected operation in a selected service and application.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td markdown="span">**Cluster**</td>
    <td markdown="span">Match spans from the selected cluster. A cluster is a named group of host machines. Wavefront populates this menu based on the selection you made from the **Operation** menu.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td markdown="span">**Shard**</td>
    <td markdown="span">Match spans from a selected shard. A shard is a named subgroup of the hosts in a particular cluster. Wavefront populates this menu based on the selection you made from the **Operation** menu.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td markdown="span">**Filters**</td>
    <td markdown="span">Match spans from a selected source (host). If you instrumented the code with custom tags, this menu cascades so you can find spans associated with custom tags. Wavefront populates this menu based on the selection you made from the **Operation** menu.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    
3. Optional. Fill in one or both of these fields to match only spans of a minimum or maximum length:  
    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col width="20%"/>
    <col width="80%"/>
    </colgroup>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td markdown="span">**Min Span**</td>
    <td markdown="span">Minimum number of milliseconds in a matching span.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td markdown="span">**Max Span**</td>
    <td markdown="span">Maximum number of milliseconds in a matching span.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    
4. Choose a **Limit** to specify the maximum number of qualifying spans to display traces for. The default limit is 20.

### Example

Suppose you want to find traces that contain spans for an operation called `dispatch`, which is called from the `delivery` service of the `beachshirts` application. You're interested only in spans that are longer than 30 milliseconds.  

1. Select the operation from the cascading **Operation** menu:
    ![tracing query builder menu](images/tracing_query_builder_menu.png)
2. Type 30 in the **Min Span** field.
    ![tracing query builder menu2](images/tracing_query_builder_menu2.png) 

### Viewing the Trace Query

Query Builder generates a query that includes the [`spans()` function](spans_queries.html) and one or more [spans filtering functions](spans_queries.html#spans-filtering-functions). For example, you can: 

1. Construct a query with Query Builder as shown [above](#example).
2. [Toggle to the Query Editor](#submitting-trace-queries) to see what the corresponding functions look like. 
    ![tracing query editor from builder](images/tracing_query_editor_from_builder.png)

At this point, you can either continue to edit the query directly, or toggle back to Query Builder. **Note:** If you change a query using the Query Editor, you cannot go back to Query Builder.

## Sorting the Result Set

You can sort a set of returned traces by selecting a sort order from the **Sort By** menu. For example: 
* You can choose **Most Recent** to start with the traces that have the most recent start times.
* You can choose **Most Spans** to start with the traces that contain the largest number of spans.

Sorting always applies after the result set has been limited. For example, suppose you limit the query to 20 matching spans, and sort the returned traces from shortest to longest. The sorted list includes only the traces that contain one or more of the 20 matching spans. We do not first sort all traces containing a matching span, and then display the 20 shortest traces.
 
**Note:** If you've enabled a sampling strategy, results are found among the spans that have actually been ingested. The query does not search through spans before theyâ€™ve been sampled.
