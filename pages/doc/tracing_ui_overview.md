The Wavefront tracing UI enables exploration of your apps and services. Once your application is instrumented for tracing, you can examine traces, spans, and RED metrics, moving easily from one browser page to the next. This doc page gives an overview of the different UI pages.

Exploring Traces, Spans, and Metrics gives more detail.

## Navigate to the Tracing UI

To navigate to the tracing UI:
1. Log in to your Wavefront cluster.
2. From the task bar:

    - Select **Applications > Inventory** to view all application services and drill down from there. 
    - Select **Applications > Traces** to start by querying for traces and drill down from there.

## Get Started: Application Services

The Application Services page is your entry point for examining your application. 

![app services](images/tracing_app_services.png)

On the Application Services page, you can:
* Select an application from the **Jump To** pulldown.
* Search for a service.
* Click inside a service box to go to the dashboard for that service.


## Examine Service Metrics and Drill Down

When you select a service, you can examine the corresponding metrics and potential hot spots in detail, and then drill down to the Traces browser. 

![examine services](images/tracing_services.png)

**Note:** The charts on this dashboard are read only.

On the page for a particular service, you can:
* Select the time and timezone in the task bar to customize the chart display. These selections are the same as for other dashboards.
* Use the **Jump To** pulldown to select a dashboard section:
  - Select Overview to examine the RED metrics that are derived from all of the spans for the service.
  - Select an individual component to examine metrics for just that component of the service. A component could be an instrumented framework or the runtime system.
* Filter the metrics based on the cluster, shard, or source.
* Select **Detailed View** or **Summarized View** to change the level of detail for charts.
* Examine the TopK charts to find out which operations are potential hot spots. The bars represent operations that execute in this service component.
* Navigate to the Traces browser:
  - Select **See All ... Traces** to display all traces that include a span from this service component. 
  - Click one of the bars in a TopK chart to display only traces that include a span for the selected operation.


## Explore Traces

In the Traces browser, you can explore the context and the details of your application's traces.

The way you access the Traces browser determines its initial content: 

* Navigate from the Service page to automatically display traces for operations you selected.
* Select **Applications > Traces** from the task bar for an empty page that you populate by [querying](trace_data_query.html).

![explore trace browser](images/tracing_traces_browser.png)

You can use the different panels in the Traces browser to:
* Query for traces and view the query results in the [traces list](#view-trace-query-results).
* Select a trace and investigate its context in the [service map panel](#investigate-the-service-map-for-a-trace).
* Select a trace and examine its spans in the [trace details panel](#examine-trace-details). 

**Note:** You can toggle the size of the traces list, service map, or trace details. 

## View Trace Query Results

In the Traces browser, you can [query](trace_data_query.html) for the traces that include spans for a particular operation, and you can view the results in a traces list.

![explore traces list](images/tracing_traces_browser_traces_list.png)

You can:

* Use Query Builder to apply filters from menus and selectively narrow down the scope of the trace query.
* Use Query Editor to limit the scope even further (advanced users).
* Sort traces with matching spans using different criteria.
* Click any trace to view its context in the [service map panel](#investigate-the-service-map-for-a-trace) or its details in the [trace details panel](#examine-trace-details).

## Investigate the Service Map for a Trace

In the Traces browser, you can investigate the services that have spans in a selected trace. 

![explore service map](images/tracing_traces_browser_service_map.png)

In the service map panel, you can:
* Investigate the flow of control between the services that contribute to a trace.
* Select a service to see a summary of its RED metrics, and click the link to the service's dashboard for more detail.
* Scroll the call graph to zoom in or out, and then click the icon to re-center it.

Note: A service is grayed out if it does not contribute any spans to the selected trace. (The service is part of at least one other trace in the traces list.)

## Examine Trace Details

In the Traces browser, you can examine the spans that belong to a selected trace. Some of these spans may represent operations executed by other services.

![trace details](images/tracing_traces_browser_trace_details.png)

In the trace details panel, you can:
* Examine the call hierarchy for the selected trace.
* Click any span to expand and see more detail.
* Explore the traceâ€™s [critical path](#a-closer-look-at-critical-paths). This is an end-to-end combination of spans that are the most blocking.


## Drill Down Into Traces and View Related Metrics

You can click any span in a trace details panel to view details about that span. If that span came from another service, you can navigate to the dashboard for that service.

![trace span details](images/tracing_traces_browser_span_details.png)

Span details include:
* Application tags. These are the application, service, cluster, and shard, as selected on the Services page.
* Other tags including the trace ID.
* A clickable link to the corresponding dashboard that lets you examine the metrics associated with the call.


## A Closer Look at Critical Paths

A [trace details pop-up](#examine-trace-details) uses an orange line to show the critical path through a trace. You can think of the critical path as an end-to-end combination of spans that are the most blocking. This is the combination of spans that determines the minimum length of the trace they belong to.

We use the following rules to determine which spans to include in a critical path (in order of applicability):
1. Ignore asynchronous spans (spans tagged with `followFrom`). 
2. Ignore spans that end before their parent starts.
3. If a child span continues after its parent, ignore that continuation period.
4. Choose longer spans over shorter siblings.
5. Choose later spans over earlier spans.
6. Choose child spans instead of their parent spans.
