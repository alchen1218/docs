## Summary
```
avg(expression[,metrics|sources|sourceTags|pointTags|<pointTagKey])
```
Returns the average (the mean) of the set of time series described by the expression. 
The results might be computed from real reported values and interpolated values. 
Use [`rawavg()`](ts_rawavg.html) if you don't need interpolation.

## Description

The `avg()` aggregation function averages the data values at each moment in time, across the time series that are represented by the expression.  

By default, `avg()` produces a single series of averages by aggregating values across all time series. You can optionally group the time series based on one or more characteristics, and obtain a separate series of averages for each group.

If any time series has data gaps, `avg()` fills them in by interpolation whenever possible. 

The `avg()`, `mavg()` and `mmedian()` functions can help you understand the tendency of the data.

* Use `avg()` or `mavg()` to get the mean (average), that is, the number in the middle of a set of values.
* Use `mmedian()` to be less sensitive to outliers. Even a single outlier can affect the result of `avg()` and `mavg()`. Use `mpercentile()` with a percentile of 50 to get the moving median.


### Grouping

Like all aggregation functions, `avg()` returns a single series of results by default. 
You can include a 'group by' parameter to obtain separate averages for groups of time series that share common metric names, source names, source tags, point tags, or values for a particular point tag key. 
The function returns a separate series of results corresponding to each group.

You can specify multiple 'group by' parameters to group the time series based on multiple characteristics. For example, `avg(ts("cpu.cpu*"), metrics, Customer)` first groups by metric names, and then groups by the values of the `Customer` point tag.


### Interpolation
If any time series has gaps in its data, Wavefront attempts to fill these gaps with interpolated values before applying the function. 
A value can be interpolated into a time series only if at least one other time series reports a real data value at the same moment in time.

Within a given time series, an interpolated value is calculated from two real reported values on either side of it. 
Sometimes interpolation is not possible--for example, when a new value has not been reported yet in a live-view chart. 
In this case, Wavefront finds the last known reported value in the series, and assigns it to any subsequent moment in time for which a real reported data value is present in some other time series. We use the last known reported value only if interpolation canâ€™t occur _and_ if the last known reported value has been reported within the last 15% of the query time in the chart window.

You can use [`rawavg()`](ts_rawavg.html) to suppress interpolation.  See [Standard Versus Raw Aggregation Functions](query_language_aggregate_functions.html).

## Examples
The following example shows the data for `sample.requests.loadavg`.

When we apply `avg()` we get a single line.

We can group by the `env()` point tag to see the differences between the dev and production servers.

## Caveats

Using [`rawavg()`](ts_rawavg.html) instead of `avg()` can significantly improve query performance because `rawavg()` does not perform interpolation.
