## Summary
```
last([<timeWindow>,] <tsExpression>)
```
Fills in gaps in each time series described by `tsExpression`, by inserting data points that have the last known value of the time series. Specify `timeWindow` to fill in data for just a limited period of time after each existing point.

## Parameters

<table>
<tbody>
<thead>
<tr><th width="20%">Parameter</th><th width="80%">Description</th></tr>
</thead>
<tr>
<td markdown="span">[timeWindow](query_language_reference.html#common-parameters)</td>
<td>Maximum amount of time to fill with inserted data points. If you omit this parameter, gaps of up to 4 weeks are completely filled.
<br>You can specify a time measurement based on the clock or calendar (1s, 1m, 1h, 1d, 1w), the window length (1vw) of the chart, or the bucket size (1bw) of the chart. Default is minutes if the unit is not specified. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td markdown="span"> [tsExpression](query_language_reference.html#query-expressions)</td>
<td>Expression that describes the time series in which to replace data gaps with the last value. </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Description

The `last()` function allows you to assign the last known reported data point value to a gap of missing data. When you add `last()` to a  `tsExpression`, a solid straight line with the value of the last reported data point will be drawn in place of gaps of missing data.

By default, `last()` applies the last reported data value to gaps of missing data for up to 4 weeks. If youâ€™d like this window to be smaller, you can use the `timeWindow` parameter. If you use `last()` with a function that uses interpolation, we apply  `last()` to the last 15% of a chart window.

## Examples

In the following example, we've zoomed in on `~sample.cpu.loadavg.1m` and see missing data.

We decide to replace the missing data with the *last* value before the gap. What that is differs for different missing data windows.

Then we replace the missing data with the first good value after the gap using `next`.
