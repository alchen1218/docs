## Summary
```
max(<expression1>, <expression2>)
max(<expression>[,metrics|sources|sourceTags|pointTags|<pointTagKey>])

max(<histograms>)
```

When used as a comparison function, returns the higher of the two values in `expression1` and `expression2`.

When used as an aggregation function, returns the highest value across the set of time series described by `expression`. The results might be computed from real reported values and interpolated values. Use [`rawmax()`](ts_rawmax.html) if you don't need interpolation.

When used as a histogram function, returns the largest value in the specified histogram.

## Description

You can use `max()` as a comparison function or as an aggregation function.

### Comparison Function

The `max()` comparison function lets you display all data points above a desired threshold, and assigns the threshold value to all data points below the threshold.

### Aggregation Function

The `max()` aggregation function finds the highest (maximum) data value at each moment in time, across the time series that are represented by the expression.

By default, `max()` produces a single series of maximums by aggregating values across all time series. You can optionally group the time series based on one or more characteristics, and obtain a separate series of maximums for each group.

If any time series has data gaps, `max()` fills them in by interpolation whenever possible. 

#### Grouping

The `max()` aggregation function returns a single series of results by default. You can include a 'group by' parameter to obtain separate maximums for groups of time series that share common metric names, source names, source tags, point tags, or values for a particular point tag key. 
The function returns a separate series of results corresponding to each group.

You can specify multiple 'group by' parameters to group the time series based on multiple characteristics. For example, `max(ts("cpu.cpu*"), metrics, Customer)` first groups by metric names, and then groups by the values of the `Customer` point tag.


#### Interpolation

If any time series has gaps in its data, Wavefront attempts to fill these gaps with interpolated values before applying the function. 
A value can be interpolated into a time series only if at least one other time series reports a real data value at the same moment in time.

Within a given time series, an interpolated value is calculated from two real reported values on either side of it. 
Sometimes interpolation is not possible--for example, when a new value has not been reported yet in a live-view chart. 
In this case, Wavefront finds the last known reported value in the series, and assigns it to any subsequent moment in time for which a real reported data value is present in some other time series. We use the last known reported value only if interpolation can’t occur _and_ if the last known reported value has been reported within the last 15% of the query time in the chart window.

You can use [`rawmax()`](ts_rawmax.html) to suppress interpolation.  See [Standard Versus Raw Aggregation Functions](query_language_aggregate_functions.html).


## Examples

### Comparison Function


The following example shows the total number of sample requests.

![ts max before](images/ts_max_comparison_before.png)

And here we see the only the metrics if there are more than 200 sample requests.

![ts max 250](images/ts_max_250.png)


### Aggregation Function

The following example shows first the total number of sample requests for 2 sources, `app-2` and `app-20`.

![before aggregation with max](images/ts_max_aggr_before.png)

And here we see what happens when we apply `max()`.

![after aggregation with max](images/ts_max_aggr_after.png)

## Caveats

Sometimes it's best to use `max()` with `align()`. 
See [Bucketing with align()](query_language_align_function.html).

Using [`rawmax()`](ts_rawmax.html) instead of `max()` can significantly improve query performance because `rawmax()` does not perform interpolation.
