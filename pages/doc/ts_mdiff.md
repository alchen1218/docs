## Description

The `mdiff()` function returns the moving difference for each time series described by the expression.
The moving difference for a time series is the difference, at each point in time, between the currently reported data value, and the data value that was reported `timeWindow` ago. For example, `mdiff(10m, ts(my.metric))` returns, at each point, the result of subtracting the data value reported 10 minutes ago from the current data value, for each specified time series.

This function does not interpolate any data values before doing the subtraction.
Â 

## Examples

In the following chart, the value at 5:00pm is 462 and the value 15 minutes before that was 258, resulting in a difference of 204.
