## Summary
```
variance(<expression>[,metrics|sources|sourceTags|pointTags|<pointTagKey>])
```
Returns the variance based on the set of time series described by the expression. 
The results might be computed from real reported values and interpolated values. 
Use [`rawvariance()`](ts_rawvariance.html) if you don't need interpolation.

## Description

The `variance()` aggregation function computes the variance among data values at each moment in time, across the time series that are represented by the expression.  

By default, `variance()` produces a single series of variances by aggregating data values across all time series. You can optionally group the time series based on one or more characteristics, and obtain a separate series of variances for each group.

If any time series has data gaps, `variance()` fills them in by interpolation whenever possible. 

### Grouping

Like all aggregation functions, `variance()` returns a single series of results by default.  You can include a 'group by' parameter to compute separate variances based on groups of time series that share common metric names, source names, source tags, point tags, or values for a particular point tag key. 
The function returns a separate series of results corresponding to each group.

You can specify multiple 'group by' parameters to group the time series based on multiple characteristics. For example, `variance(ts("cpu.cpu*"), metrics, Customer)` first groups by metric names, and then groups by the values of the `Customer` point tag.

### Interpolation

If any time series has gaps in its data, Wavefront attempts to fill these gaps with interpolated values before applying the function. 
A value can be interpolated into a time series only if at least one other time series reports a real data value at the same moment in time.

Within a given time series, an interpolated value is calculated from two real reported values on either side of it. 
Sometimes interpolation is not possible--for example, when a new value has not been reported yet in a live-view chart. 
In this case, Wavefront finds the last known reported value in the series, and assigns it to any subsequent moment in time for which a real reported data value is present in some other time series. We use the last known reported value only if interpolation canâ€™t occur _and_ if the last known reported value has been reported within the last 15% of the query time in the chart window.

You can use [`rawvariance()`](ts_rawvariance.html) to suppress interpolation.  See [Standard Versus Raw Aggregation Functions](query_language_aggregate_functions.html).


## Examples

The following example shows the variance for request latency for all servers in the sample set.

The next example shows the same query, but groups the results by environment (`env` point tag).
