summary: Chart types and configuration options for each chart type.
---

Charts allow you to view and examine your metrics. You can [interact directly with charts](ui_examine_data.html)--zoom in, zoom out, change the time window, and so on. You can work with your charts in real time, and create an alert or invoke AI Genie directly from a chart.

Wavefront supports a rich set of chart types and chart configuration options.

* When you create a new dashboard, you're prompted to add a chart, and can select a chart type.
* You can add charts to dashboards and customize both the chart type and formatting options such as the legend.

{% include shared/badge.html content="While every Wavefront user can view charts and make temporary changes, you must have [Dashboard permission](permissions_overview.html) to save changes you make to charts." %}


## Queries Tab (All Charts)

For each chart (with the exception of a Markdown chart) you specify one or more queries.

When you select **Queries**, you can:
* View queries for the chart or add queries.
* Use Query Builder or Query Editor.
* Clone, delete, or hide one or more queries.
* Bring up AI Genie for anomaly detection and forecasting.

## Line Plot Chart

Line plots are well suited both for single time series and multiple time series. You can customize many aspects of your line plots.

A **line plot** represents interpolated point buckets. The X axis represents the amount of time in your time window and the Y axis represents the value associated with the data based on that time.

Missing data is represented by a dashed line. The dashed line only gives a visual representation of the data stream; it _does not_ represent values of the missing data. If you hover over the chart, you won't see values where the gap threshold has been applied. Use the **Format > Gap Threshold** property to set the amount of time before gaps of missing data display as dashed lines.

### Format Tab
<table>
<tbody>
<thead>
<tr><th width="20%">Option</th><th width="80%">Description</th></tr>
</thead>
<tr>
<td>Summarization</td>
<td>Summarization method for grouping raw, reported data points, and for mapping them to displayable values. When displaying metrics, Wavefront determines the chart resolution and establishes an appropriate time interval as the chart's bucket size.  We then aggregate (combine) the raw data values that are reported within each such time interval, to produce a single value to display for each bucket. The chosen summarization method determines how the aggregation is performed.

<ul>
<li><strong>Average</strong> - Display the average (mean) of the raw data values in each bucket.</li>
<li><strong>Median</strong> - Display the median of the raw data values in each bucket.</li>
<li><strong>Min</strong> - Display the minimum raw data value in each bucket.</li>
<li><strong>Max</strong> - Display the maximum raw data value in each bucket.</li>

<tr>
<td>Display Source Events</td>
<td>If checked, displays events generated by firing alerts associated with any source displayed on the chart.
You can also use events() queries to <a href="charts_events_displaying.html">Display events in charts</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Gap Threshold</td>
<td>Controls when data is considered missing when there are gaps in the reporting of the data. The gap threshold is expressed in seconds and defaults to 60 seconds. </td>
</tr>

### Axis Tab

The Axis tab let's you customize the Y axis. The customizaiton is the same for both Line Plot and Point Plot.

<table>
<tbody>
<thead>
<tr><th width="15%">Option</th><th width="85%">Description</th></tr>
</thead>
<tr>
<td>Y-Axis</td>
<td>The scale of the Y-axis: linear or logarithmic. Default is linear. In most cases, linear is sufficient as long as there is not a large difference in measurement between the reported data points. If there's a large difference in measurement scale, use the logarithmic scale. By default, the logarithmic scale is set to the power of 10. You can configure the scale in the adjacent text field.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Min/Max</td>
<td>The minimum and maximum value on the Y-axis. If you are using a double Y-axis, you can specify min/max values for each Y-axis (By default, set to auto).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Unit</td>
<td>The unit of measurement to assign to the reported chart values label that appears along the Y-axis of the chart. This unit is merely a label and <em>does not</em> change the unit of measurement. If you are using a double Y-axis, you can specify a unit for each Y-axis.
<p>The supported units are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time - Ranges from yoctoseconds (ys) to years (yr)</li>
<li>IEC/Binary - data size in IEC/Binary units. Ranges from B (bytes) to YiB</li>
<li>SI - data rate in SI units. Ranges from bps (bits/s) to Ybps</li>
<p>You can select the <strong>Dynamic Units</strong> or <strong>ICE/Binary Unit Prefixes</strong> check box to fine-tune the unit. If you select <strong>ICE/Binary Unit Prefixes</strong>, then Wavefront uses 1024 instead of 1000 as the step to the next unit prefix. </p>
</ul>

## Stacked Area Chart

![stacked area](images/stacked_area.png)

A **stacked area** chart is based on the line chart and behaves similarly except that:

The magnitude of each line is filled in as a solid block with blocks stacked one on top of each other. With the default Stack Type of zero, the peak of the chart at any time is the sum of the magnitudes of all  sources at that time.

The stacked area chart is a great way to visualize data when you want to determine at a glance which queries have the largest magnitude at any point in time. It is most commonly used to visually compare two or more quantities.

### Format Tab

## Line Plot

![line plot](images/line_plot.png)

A **line plot** chart represents interpolated point buckets. The X axis represents the amount of time in your time window and the Y axis represents the value associated with the data based on that time.

In a line chart, missing data is represented by a dashed line. The dashed line only gives a visual representation of the data stream; it _does not_ represent values of the missing data. If you hover over the chart, you won't see values where the gap threshold has been applied. Use the Gap Threshold property to set the amount of time before gaps of missing data display as dashed lines.

## Point Plot

![point plot](images/point_plot.png)

A **point plot** chart displays point buckets *without* any interpolation. Like a line chart, the X-axis represents the amount of time in your time window, and the Y-axis represents the value associated with the data during that time window.

## Stacked Area

![stacked area](images/stacked_area.png)

A **stacked area** chart is based on the line chart and behaves similarly except that:

The magnitude of each line is filled in as a solid block with blocks stacked one on top of each other. With the default Stack Type of zero, the peak of the chart at any time is the sum of the magnitudes of all  sources at that time.

The stacked area chart is a great way to visualize data when you want to determine at a glance which queries have the largest magnitude at any point in time. It is most commonly used to visually compare two or more quantities.

The **Stack** Type option controls the style of a Stacked Area chart.

<table>
<tbody>
<thead>
<tr><th width="20%">Option</th><th width="80%">Description</th></tr>
</thead>
<tr>
<td>Stack Type</td>
<td>
The following stack types are supported.
<ul>
<li><strong>Zero</strong> - Displays the chart as from 0 up to the sum of all points at that time interval. Default.</li>
<li><strong>Normalize to 0-1</strong> - Results in a similar shape to <strong>Zero</strong> except that the values are normalized so that they fill the range between 0 and 1 with the peak of the chart always a solid line drawn at magnitude 1.</li>
<li><strong>Minimize Weighted Change</strong> - Plots the area while attempting to minimize the weighted change in the slope of the lines. Both this and the <strong>Center the Stream</strong> option tend to result in similar shapes in which the chart does not show a solid area beginning at 0.</li>
<li><strong>Center the Stream</strong> - Represents the collective magnitude of the queries displayed on the chart with the band narrowing or widening as the metrics fluctuate over time.</li>
<li><strong>Stacked Columns</strong> - Shows the result as a set of stacked columns, which resemble a bar chart.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Here's an example of **Center the Stream**:

Here's an example of **Stacked Columns**, which resembles a bar chart:

## Scatter Plot

![scatter plot](images/scatter_plot.png)

A **scatter plot** differs from all other Wavefront charts in that it compares time series expressions against one another. All other Wavefront charts compare time series against time.

The scatter plot is useful for examining whether two (or more) data sets are positively, negatively, or not correlated. Each point on a scatter plot represents a summary of points over a specified amount of time. In Wavefront terminology, these summarized points are called buckets. You can view the extent of the summarization applied in the bottom left of each chart.

When you create a Wavefront scatter plot, you use two queries. One specifies the expression that is mapped to the X axis, the other the expression that is mapped to the Y axis.

Series matching for the scatter plot ensures that reporting sources are actively reporting metrics for all specified time series expressions.
* If a unique series (metric + source + point tags) is actively reporting for only one time series expression, it is not displayed.
* If no sources are reporting for all time series expressions, then NO DATA displays on the chart.
* If multiple X and Y-axes are defined, ensure that each time series expression associated to an axes has at least one common source reporting. Otherwise NO DATA is shown on the chart.

Only unique series that are reporting for every defined time series expression display.

The following option controls the style of a Scatter Plot chart.

<table>
<tbody>
<thead>
<tr><th width="20%">Option</th><th width="80%">Description</th></tr>
</thead>
<tr>
<td>Use Time-based Coloring</td>
<td>Modify the color of the data points so that darker colors represent more recent data, and lighter colors represent older data.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Tabular View

![tabular view](images/tabular_view.png)

A **tabular view** chart displays data per stream in a table format. A tabular view displays only one data point value per source. The value is a summary of all of available data points, as set in the Summarized By field, based on the configured time window.

The following options control the style of a Tabular View chart.

<table>
<tbody>
<thead>
<tr><th width="20%">Option</th><th width="80%">Description</th></tr>
</thead>
<tr>
<td>Columns</td>
<td>Configure options for table columns.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Show Sources/Labels</td>
<td>Whether to display the sources and labels in the chart. A label is the metric name associated with the data or the query expression resulting from an aggregation.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Show Raw Values</td>
<td>Whether to display the raw metric values or values using scientific notation (SI).
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Group by Sources</td>
<td>Whether to group the column results by source.  If you select <strong>Group by Source</strong>, the table lists the grouped sources in the first column and the values for each metric in separate columns.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sort Values Descending</td>
<td>Whether to sort the value column by descending value.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


## Single Stat View

![single stat](images/single_stat.png)

A **single stat** chart plots a single series on a chart and displays a summarized value for that series in large font on the chart. The font size and placement of the displayed value can be unique for each chart. A common use case is displaying instantaneous values of critical metrics on an overhead display.

In addition to general options, a Single Stat chart supports Sparkline options and Single Stat options:

### Sparkline Options

A sparkline is a small graph that summarizes the series displays. You can customize the sparkline with these options:

<table>
<tbody>
<thead>
<tr><th width="20%">Option</th><th width="80%">Description</th></tr>
</thead>
<tr>
<td>Sparkline</td>
<td>
Position of the sparkline. The options are:
<ul>
<li><strong>Bottom</strong> which means below the single stat.</li>
<li><strong>Background</strong> which places the sparkline in the background of the single stat</li> <li><strong>None</strong> for no sparkline on the chart.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Line Color</td>
<td>The color of the sparkline.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Value/Color Mapping</td>
<td>The color of the single stat based on its value. You add and remove color thresholds using the plus and minus buttons. Click each field to specify the colors and threshold values.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Color Applies To</td>
<td>Whether the Value/Color Mapping applies to the color of the single stat text or the chart background.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fill Color</td>
<td>The fill color for the chart area below the sparkline.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Value/Color Mapping Example:
In the following example the single stat is green if its value is less than 150, yellow when the value is between 150 and 200, and orange when the value is greater than 200:

![value_color](images/value_color.png)

### Single Stat Options

A Single Stat chart supports the following options:

<table>
<tbody>
<thead>
<tr><th width="20%">Option</th><th width="80%">Description</th></tr>
</thead>
<tr>
<td>Display Value</td>
<td>The position of the sparkline. The options are
<ul>
<li><strong>Bottom</strong> which means below the single stat </li>
<li><strong>Background</strong> which places the sparkline in the background of the single stat</li>
<li><strong>None</strong> for no sparkline on the chart</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Horizontal Position</td>
<td>The horizontal pisition of the single stat. The options are Left, Middle, or Right of the chart.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Text Font Size</td>
<td>The font size of the single stat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Text Color</td>
<td>The text color of the single stat.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Prefix</td>
<td>A string to prefix the single stat.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Value/Text Mapping</td>
<td>Strings to display instead of the metric value based on the value. You add and remove value thresholds using the plus and minus buttons. Click each field to specify the strings and threshold values.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Decimal Precision</td>
<td>Number of digits to display after the decimal point in the summarized value.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Postfix</td>
<td>A string to append to the single stat.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Value/Text Mapping Example

In the following example:

![value_text](images/value_text.png)

the string **lower** displays when the metrics value is below 150, **middle** displays when the value is between 150 and 200, and **upper** displays when the value is above 200.

## Markdown

![markdown](images/markdown.png)

A **Markdown** chart allows you to provide in-depth text descriptions of a dashboard and individual charts. In addition to Markdown formatted text, you can use links, images hosted outside Wavefront, and [dashboard variables](dashboards_variables.html). You can refer to the value of a dashboard variable with the query variable syntax **${var_name}** and the label of the variable using **%{var_name}**. Using a label instead of the variable value could be useful for list variables that might show the dropdown labels such as: Any, 1 Year, 3 Years which could map to opaque values such as -1, 1, 3.


A Markdown chart only has General options and Markdown options.
