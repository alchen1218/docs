Send data from several sources to a Wavefront proxy or use direct ingestion, then add dashboards to monitor exactly what you need.</p> </td>

<p>Charts help you visualize data and find problems. Jason shows how you pick a chart type and how you configure a chart to view exactly the information you need. A stacked area chart shows the total requests from all environments but also each environment individually. Charts show the data, and you use query language functions to customize what you can see. </p>

<p>Wavefront supports sophisticated alerts that go far beyond traditional alerting systems. Clement explains how alerts work using the example of a simple threshold alert. The alert fires when the threshold any of the time series being monitored exceeds the threshold for 10 minutes. Wavefront then sends an alert notification to a specified alert target. when the alert fires and again when the alert is resolved for each time series. Additional examples are shown in other videos. </p>

<p>Jason demos in the Wavefront UI how you can find firing alerts and look at alert details. He also shows how you can look at alert events in a chart window. </p>
