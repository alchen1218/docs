Product versions and features move to end-of-life as part of the normal software development lifecycle, security improvements, and other factors. To support planning for upgrades, this document provides information on upcoming lifecycle changes. While every effort is made to provide sufficient notice of changes, security issues or other factors may occasionally lead to accelerated end-of-life dates.
