summary: Learn about Wavefront SDKs that enable applications to report metrics, histograms, and trace data.
---

Wavefront supports a suite of SDKs that developers can use to instrument applications for observability. Instrumenting an application enables it to send metrics, histograms, and/or trace data to Wavefront for storage and visualization. The SDKs are available for most popular programming languages, and are available in GitHub. 

**Note:** If you have already used a 3rd party solution such as Jaeger or Zipkin to instrument your application for tracing, you can simply set up a Wavefront integration to forward the trace data to Wavefront.

Will there be any integrations that facilitate setup with an SDK?

## Levels of Support for Instrumenting Applications

Wavefront organizes its observability SDKs into 3 groups, which correspond to different levels of support for instrumenting your applications. SDKs for each level are available in popular programming languages. The levels are numbered for convenient reference.

The Level 3 SDKs involve the least amount of work, with the most gain. A best practice is to use the Level 3 SDKs wherever possible, and then use Level 2 SDKs to augment any areas of your code that might not be covered. 

## SDKs for Framework Instrumentation

Framework-level SDKs (Level 3 SDKs) instrument the APIs of popular frameworks for building microservices in a cloud-based application. Each SDK in this group instruments a particular framework in a particular programming language. Wavefront provides SDKs for many common microservices frameworks, so you can collect observability data from the inbound requests and outbound responses of every microservice in your application, with minimal code changes. See above for [supported SDK languages](#SDKlevels).

Framework-level SDKs are a good place to start if you are new to instrumentation because these SDKs are simple to use: 
* Depending on the SDK, you might edit a configuration file or instantiate a few helper objects in your code. No further coding is required.
* When you recompile and deploy your application, the SDK automatically collects predefined metrics, histograms, and trace data from the framework's operations, and then sends the data to Wavefront, where you can visualize it in predefined dashboards.

For example, suppose you have a Java microservice that uses a Jersey-compatible framework for building RESTful web services. The following screen shows predefined metrics and histograms from that microservice, after you have instrumented it with the Wavefront observability SDK for the Jersey framework. You can view RED metrics that measure the microservice's Request rate, Error rate, and Duration. SDKs for other frameworks might collect latencies, payload sizes, runtime information, and so on.

If you need deeper instrumentation, you can later augment specific function calls with one of the lower-level SDKs.


## General-Purpose SDKs for Custom and Runtime Instrumentation  

General-purpose SDKs (Level 2 SDKs) enable you to instrument critical areas in your code to send custom business metrics, histograms, and trace data to Wavefront. These SDKs are suitable for instrumenting entire applications, or for supplementing one or more framework-level SDKs in a microservice, where you might need to instrument functions that are not handled by any instrumented framework. See above for [supported SDK languages](#SDKlevels).

Wavefront provides separate SDKs for 3 different areas of instrumentation. You can use any of these SDKs alone (for example, tracing only), or in combination with others (tracing, custom metrics, and runtime metrics):

</colgroup>

<tr><th>Support For</th><th>Description</th></tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td markdown="span">Custom business metrics</td>
<td markdown="span">SDKs that implement specifications for collecting and reporting metrics. Includes support for counters, delta counters, meters, gauges, timers, and histograms.</td>
</tr>

<td markdown="span">Custom trace data</td>
<td markdown="span"> SDKs that implement specifications (such as [OpenTracing](https://www.opentracing.io)) for creating, sampling, and reporting spans and traces. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td markdown="span">Runtime metrics</td>
<td markdown="span"> SDKs that automatically collect and report metrics and histograms from your application's runtime system. The specific metrics depend on the programming language.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The SDKs for collecting custom metrics and trace data require some code changes beyond setting up helper objects in your microservice. In particular, you'll need to instantiate objects for each type of data you want to collect, and modify each function of interest.

For example, suppose you have a Java microservice with a critical backend operation that writes to a proprietary database. Even though you've used a framework-level SDK to instrument the RESTful APIs of the microservice, you'd also like to track how many critical writes are performed, and you'd like to see how long these operations take. You can:
* Use a Wavefront SDK for custom business metrics to instrument the write operation to maintain a count.
* Use a Wavefront OpenTracing SDK to instrument the write operation to add spans to the microservice's traces. 


## Core SDKs for Sending Raw Data to Wavefront

The core SDKs (Level 1 SDKs) enable you to send raw values to Wavefront for ingestion as metrics, histograms, or trace data. A core SDK is especially useful for creating utilities that obtain existing values from a data store and send them as observability data to Wavefront. See above for [supported SDK languages](#SDKlevels).

A core SDK is built into each of the other observability SDKs to enable applications to communicate with Wavefront in one of two ways:
* Send data directly to the Wavefront service ([direct ingestion](direct_ingestion.html)). This technique gets you up and running with minimal preparation, but is best suited for small-scale uses.
* Send data to a [Wavefront proxy](proxies_installing.html), which then forwards the data to the Wavefront service. This technique is recommended for large-scale deployments, because the proxy provides resilience to internet outages, control over data queuing and filtering, and more.


<!---
**Note:** An alternative approach, without using an SDK, is to configure a Wavefront proxy to transform existing values into a data format that Wavefront recognizes.

## Other SDKs

You can access our SDKs from our public GitHub repository. We're constantly adding functionality to existing SDKs, and adding new SDKs. For example:

* [Wavefront Java Top-Level Project](https://github.com/wavefrontHQ/java) - several independent projects for sending metrics from your Java application to Wavefront. The project includes a Java client, dropwizard metrics project, and more.
* The [wavefront-kubernetes Github repository](https://www.github.com/wavefrontHQ/wavefront-kubernetes) - a new SDK that includes a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler Adapter that allows you to scale pods based on metrics available from the Wavefront Service.
* The [Wavefront AWS Lambda integration](integrations_aws_lambda.html) - allows you to extract standard metrics, and use the code and samples in GitHub to extract business metrics using Python, node.js, and Go.
