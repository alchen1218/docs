summary: Learn about Wavefront SDKs that enable applications to report metrics, histograms, and trace data.
---

Wavefront supports a suite of SDKs that developers can use to instrument applications for observability. Instrumenting an application enables it to collect and send metrics, histograms, and/or trace data to Wavefront for storage and visualization. The SDKs are available for most popular programming languages, and are available in GitHub. 

**Note:** If you have already used a 3rd party solution such as Jaeger or Zipkin to instrument your application for tracing, you can simply set up a [Wavefront integration](tracing_integrations.html) to forward the trace data to Wavefront.

## What Do You Want to Collect?

Wavefront observability SDKs let you instrument your application to collect and send different kinds of observability data. These SDKs are available in many popular programming languages.

The SDKs that collect telemetry data from framework APIs provide the most gain with the least amount of work. Use these SDKs wherever possible. Then, supplement them with SDKs for metrics and OpenTracing to augment any areas of your code that might not be covered. 

## SDKs That Instrument Frameworks

Most cloud-based applications consist of microservices that are built with component frameworks for managing inbound requests and outbound responses. Wavefront provides SDKs that instrument the APIs of many common microservices frameworks. If your application is built with a supported framework, you can use the corresponding Wavefront SDK to automatically collect telemetry data from the framework's APIs, with minimal code changes. 

Wavefront provides SDKs that instrument frameworks in these [supported languages](#SDKlevels).

A framework-instrumentation SDK is a good place to start if you are new to instrumentation: 
* Setup is simple. You either edit a configuration file or instantiate a few helper objects in your code. No further coding is required.
* The SDK automatically defines the metrics, histograms, and trace data to be collected. You simply run the recompiled application to start the flow of telemetry data to Wavefront. 
* Wavefront provides predefined charts and dashboards to help you visualize and drill down through the telemetry data.

For example, suppose you have a Java microservice that uses a Jersey-compatible framework for building RESTful web services. After you instrument your microservice with the Wavefront SDK for Jersey, your application collects predefined metrics, histograms, and trace data from the Jersey-compatible framework and sends the data to Wavefront. You can then use the following charts to view RED metrics, which measure the microservice's Request rate, Error rate, and Duration. (SDKs for other frameworks might collect latencies, payload sizes, runtime information, and so on.)

**Note:** If you need deeper instrumentation, you can later augment specific function calls with an SDK for collecting metrics or trace data.


## SDKs For Collecting Metrics and Histograms

Wavefront provides SDKs that implement standard metrics libraries in popular programming languages. You use these SDKs to instrument critical areas in your code to collect and send custom business metrics and histograms to Wavefront: 
* You can use a metrics-collection SDK alone to instrument an entire application. 
* You can use a metrics-collection SDK along with a framework-instrumentation SDK, to instrument functions that are not handled by the instrumented framework. 

Wavefront provides SDKs for collecting metrics in these [supported languages](#SDKlevels).

Different metrics-collection SDKs provide different capabilities:
* Some SDKs let you instrument functions with counters, delta counters, meters, gauges, timers, and histograms. These SDKs require some code changes beyond setting up helper objects. In particular, you'll need to instantiate objects for each type of metric you want to collect, and modify each function of interest.
* Some SDKs automatically collect and report metrics and histograms from your application's runtime system. The specific metrics depend on the programming language.

Sample use case:
* Suppose you have a microservice with a critical backend operation that writes to a proprietary database. Even though you've used a framework-level SDK to instrument the RESTful APIs, you'd also like to track how many database writes are performed. You can use a metrics-collection SDK to instrument the write operation to maintain a count.


## SDKs For Collecting Trace Data

Wavefront provides SDKs that implement the [OpenTracing](https://www.opentracing.io) specification for creating, sampling, and reporting spans and traces. You use these SDKs to instrument critical areas in your code to collect and send custom trace data to Wavefront:
* You can use a Wavefront OpenTracing SDK alone to instrument an entire application. 
* You can use a Wavefront OpenTracing SDK along with a framework-instrumentation SDK, to instrument functions that are not handled by the instrumented framework. 

Wavefront provides OpenTracing SDKs in these [supported languages](#SDKlevels).

Sample use cases:
* Suppose your application is already instrumented with a 3rd party distributed tracing system. If that 3rd party system is OpenTracing-compliant, you can replace it with the Wavefront OpenTracing SDK in the same language.

* Suppose you have a microservice with a critical backend operation that writes to a proprietary database. Even though you've used a framework-level SDK to instrument the RESTful APIs of the microservice, you'd like to see if anything is holding up the database write operation. You can use an OpenTracing SDK to instrument the operation so that it adds spans to the microservice's traces. 


## SDKs for Sending Raw Data to Wavefront

Some Wavefront SDKs enable you to send raw values to Wavefront for ingestion as metrics, histograms, or trace data. You normally use these "sender" SDKs indirectly when you use other Wavefront SDKs that depend on them. However, you might use a sender SDK directly, for example, to create a utility that obtains existing values from a data store and sends those values to Wavefront. 

Wavefront provides sender SDKs in these [supported languages](#SDKlevels).

A sender SDK is built into each of the other observability SDKs to enable applications to communicate with Wavefront in one of two ways:
* Send data directly to the Wavefront service ([direct ingestion](direct_ingestion.html)). This technique gets you up and running with minimal preparation, but is best suited for small-scale uses.
* Send data to a [Wavefront proxy](proxies_installing.html), which then forwards the data to the Wavefront service. This technique is recommended for large-scale deployments, because the proxy provides resilience to internet outages, control over data queuing and filtering, and more.


<!---
**Note:** An alternative approach, without using an SDK, is to configure a Wavefront proxy to transform existing values into a data format that Wavefront recognizes.

## Other SDKs

You can access our SDKs from our public GitHub repository. We're constantly adding functionality to existing SDKs, and adding new SDKs. For example:

* [Wavefront Java Top-Level Project](https://github.com/wavefrontHQ/java) - several independent projects for sending metrics from your Java application to Wavefront. The project includes a Java client, dropwizard metrics project, and more.
* The [wavefront-kubernetes Github repository](https://www.github.com/wavefrontHQ/wavefront-kubernetes) - a new SDK that includes a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler Adapter that allows you to scale pods based on metrics available from the Wavefront Service.
* The [Wavefront AWS Lambda integration](integrations_aws_lambda.html) - allows you to extract standard metrics, and use the code and samples in GitHub to extract business metrics using Python, node.js, and Go.
