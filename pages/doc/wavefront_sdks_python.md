This page lists the available [Wavefront observability SDKs](wavefront_sdks.html) for collecting metrics, histograms, and trace data from the microservices in a Python application. For each SDK, click on the link to see the detailed setup steps.

<!---
## Framework-level Python SDKs

Each framework-level SDK collects metrics, histograms, and trace data from a particular Python framework or component. Setup consists of configuring and instantiating several helper objects in your microservice. No other code updates are needed.

## Custom-level Python SDKs

Each SDK enables you to instrument critical-path, proprietary business operations that are not based on an instrumented framework. 
Setup consists of configuring and instantiating several helper objects in your microservice, defining the particular types of data to be collected, and augmenting the individual business operations with calls to SDK methods.

<tr>
<td markdown="span">[Trace data](https://github.com/wavefrontHQ/wavefront-opentracing-sdk-python)</td>
<td>Implements the [OpenTracing](https://www.opentracing.io) specification, so you can instrument custom business operations to send traces and spans to Wavefront. </td></tr>

## Core Python SDK

The core SDK enables you send raw values to Wavefront for ingestion as metrics, histograms, or trace data.
