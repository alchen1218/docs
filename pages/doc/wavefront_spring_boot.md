The Wavefront Spring Boot Starter allows you to quickly configure your environment, so Spring Boot components send metrics, histograms, and traces/spans to the Wavefront service. After you've completed setup, you can examine the data in a preconfigured dashboard.

## Getting Spring Boot Data into Wavefront

You have two options for getting Spring Boot data into Wavefront:
* Wavefront included a [Micrometer integration](micrometer.html) for several years. This custom integration allows you to send your own metrics and create dashboards for them. The integration uses the [Wavefront Reporter for Micrometer](https://github.com/micrometer-metrics/micrometer).
* Wavefront made the Wavefront Spring Boot Starter available recently. It supports easy integration of metrics, histograms, and traces/spans and includes pre-configured customizable dashboards.

### Features

If you use the Wavefront Spring Boot Starter:
* You have out of the box tracing support for all the common Spring Boot components, such as Spring MVC, Spring Web, Spring Async, Feign, Hysterix, JMS, JDBC, Mongo, Zuul, Reactor, RxJava, Redis, Logging, Spring Messaging, and Rabbit MQ.
* The spans in your applications are automatically converted to the Wavefront span format.
* The logs generated by the logger in your application are automatically converted to span logs, and you can view the span logs in [Wavefront Tracing Browser](tracing_ui_overview.html#drill-down-into-spans-and-view-metrics-and-span-logs). You do not need to do any code change for it.

{% include note.html content="You will not see span logs in the freemium offering. Reach out to us on our public [Slack channel](https://www.wavefront.com/join-public-slack) for more details." %}

## Getting Started

If you are starting a new tracing project, add the Wavefront dependency using the Spring Initializer or if you are configuring an existing tracing application, you only need to add a few lines of code.
<br/>  
Once you initialize your project, you can send data to Wavefront via [direct ingestion](direct_ingestion.html) or via the [Wavefront proxy](proxies.html). If you are trying it out for the first time, use direct ingestion. For details, see [Getting Data into Wavefront](wavefront_data_ingestion.html) 

![Ways to get started with the Wavefront Spring Boot offering](/images/spring_boot_getting_started.png)

### Prerequisites
* Java 8 or above
* Spring Boot 2.3.0 or above

### Step 1: Initialize Your Project

Initialization is different for existing or new projects 

* **Initialize an Existing Project** <br/>
  Open your application and the following code to your pom.xml file. 
    ```
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.wavefront</groupId>
      <artifactId>wavefront-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
      <version>2.0.0</version>
    </dependency>
    ```
    Next, see [Step 2:  View Your Data on Wavefront](#step-2--view-your-data-on-wavefront).
    
* **Initialize a New Project** <br/>
  1. Navigate to the [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/).
  2. Define the project name, Spring version, and other parameters.
      <br/> ![Spring Initializr](images/spring_boot_initializr.png)
  3. Select Wavefront from the dependency list and click **Generate**. 
      <br/> **{Add Screenshot}**
  4. Next, add the application logic and start the project.<br/> 
     You need a tracing application to view the trace data in Wavefront, else some of the charts will not show data.
  
### Step 2:  View Your Data on Wavefront

Follow the steps given below to start sending your data to Wavefront and to view them:

1. Run your project. 
   ```
   `mvn spring-boot:run`
   ```
   You see the following printed on your console:
   <br/>Example:
    ```
      To share this account, make sure the following is added to your configuration:

       management.metrics.export.wavefront.api-token=44444-34this-45is-123a-sampletoken
       management.metrics.export.wavefront.uri=https://wavefront.surf

      Connect to your Wavefront dashboard using this one-time use link:
      https://wavefront.surf/us/example
    ```
2. Click `https://wavefront.surf/us/<name>` and you are taken to the Wavefront Service dashboard where you can examine the data sent by your application.
    {% include note.html content="Want to see the cool information you can gather from the Service Dashboard? See [Explore the Default Service Dashboard](tracing_ui_overview.html#explore-the-default-service-dashboard)." %}

### Optional: Custom Configurations

You can add the following custom configurations to your projects `application.properties` file.

* Wavefront allows you to share dashboards with other authorized users.<br/>
  1. Save the link that you used to access the Service dashboard.
  1. Copy and paste the properties that were printed on your terminal.
      ```
      management.metrics.export.wavefront.api-token=<Enter_Token>
      management.metrics.export.wavefront.uri=https://wavefront.surf
      ```
  1. Restart your application.
  1. Now, share the link with other users and they will be able to access your Service dashboard.
* Send data to Wavefront using the Wavefront Proxy.
  {% include note.html content="Before sending data via the proxy you need to [Install and Manage Wavefront Proxies](proxies_installing.html)."%}
  ```
  management.metrics.export.wavefront.uri=http://<Proxy_Host>:2878
  ```
